26,This Week in Coffee
27,"For those who don't know, Aeropress has an amazing free app (I have it on Android but I think they have it for iPhone too) called Aeromatic. It's filled with different recipes, a slick timer with audio cues, and will let you store your own recipes as well. Definitely found it worth the download."
28,"Hi All,"
29,"I'm a wine professional and passionate lover of all beverages with a rich story (tea, wine, coffee being my big 3)."
30,"I am making the transition from wholesale/distribution and into importing. More specifically, I wish to become a coffee & tea importer with the possibility of starting an online shop."
31,"Although I have the passion, my background is in wine and I lack the knowledge of the coffee industry as whole, especially on the supply chain side of things (producing, sourcing, importing, distribution, wholesale, retail, etc)"
32,"Studying and research isn't the issue, but the amount of info out there is overwhelming and I am looking for recommendations on what to focus on. So, my question is, for professionals and non-professionals in the coffee trade, are there any books, classes or certifications you would recommend, given my desire to learn about the industry as well as starting an import/DTC business?"
33,"Hi everyone, new here so hopefully I've landed in the right spot. Our company is looking to add coffee service as an offering to our clients and I am working out all the details and associated costs. I've been looking at brewers that drip into airpots and I'm curious if anyone has any input for what type is best for that kind of service."
34,"Our events are usually 150-250 people, oftentimes weddings. I've been reading a lot about the amount of products needed, I've got it all diagramed out and all hypothetic margins calculated. The one thing that I'm kind of stuck on (due to my unfamiliarity with them) is the brewers. We have some 2.2L airpots and I would imagine that we'd need to brew 50 cups per hour over 2-3 hours. I saw some that were ~$250 from Bunn (their base model I believe) as well as, ya know, $4,000 ones that obviously I'm not interested in."
35,"So my question is, what's the best kind of brewer to use in regards to cost effectiveness and longevity/ease of use? Should I just get a normal, large coffee pot and fill the airpots, or should I get a brewer that dispenses directly into the airpots? Looking for ease of use for my staff (they're grumpy bartenders), mobility (I don't want to tap into any water lines), ease of cleaning, etc. Is there anyone here that could maybe point me in the right direction? I'd appreciate any help as I've already scoured the internet and I heard you guys really like coffee around here. Please help me haha."
36,Thanks so much for reading and any helpful replies!
37,"I have a small Vending machine business,  a particular coffee machine has recently been relocated to a less busy location and they're complaining the drinks are too weak, the coffee looks noticeably lighter in colour and the flavour is weaker"
38,I've turned the machine settings up as high as they go so it's grinding the maximum amount of beans
39,There were no complaints at it's previous location so it's not something I noticed before now
40,The bean canister holds about 3kg of beans and was last filled maybe 3-4 weeks ago so that's how long the current beans have been out of the foil bag
41,Could this also be a water pressure problem? The same amount of water is getting into the cup but maybe its under less pressure so it isn't absorbing as much flavour?
42,"I just got a cheap Brix refractometer to measure TDS. Do I need to take the reading immediately while the coffee is fresh out of the pot, or can I set a sample to the side and enjoy my coffee first? Basically, I'm not sure if evaporation will effect the reading if the liquid sits too long."
43,"Within the next week or two I'm closing on my new home (sailboat), so naturally I'm thinking where to put my espresso machine (very important). Counter top space is a premium and everything needs to be somehow attached/anchored down or put away when not in use."
44,"I've seen counter built in machines like Modbar before this would be ideal since it takes minimal counter space and it isn't going anywhere. I'd go with Modbar except its outrageously expensive and the under counter unit is hugely massive, I get it, its for commercial coffee shops and needs to make consistant espresso shots all day. However, I will only be making a few lattes a day."
45,"I've attempted to look for alternatives but modbar seems to flooded the market (good for them, annoying for me), not sure if they are the only game in town."
46,This leads me to two questions:
47,Is anyone aware of something like Modbar designed and priced for the home market? (preferred)
48,"Is it possible to buy just the Modbar above counter grouphead, so I can pipe the steam from a dissected home unit just below the counter. (Read warning below)"
49,"Warning: Working with pressurized gasses can be very dangerous if you don't know what your doing, I've worked on piping for scuba fill systems at a previous job (4000psi / ~275bar) so I'm well aware of these dangers - however the professional in me requires this warning."
50,
51,"Edit: Mar 3,2023 -  Modbar is impractical, I am looking for something with a simular on counter space usage. There is a  corner in the galley (kitchen) with unused space that I can put a machine below the counter, but something considerably smaller/less power usage then a Modbar."
52,"Edit 2: Shoutout to u/nguye569 for pointing out the Odyssey Argos it seems to be what I'm looking for even if its a full above counter unit, since it has a tiny countertop footprint, is plumbed in & looks super aesthetically attractive (to me)."

58,"All of my brews until today I was using the Hoffman technique, not sure why, I just followed it and didn’t mind checking other techniques."
59,"Well today I tried one from Matt Winton, which had a way more aggressive pouring (I’m assuming this was the biggest change), and I was surprised by the result, it tastes super good!"
60,"I like both techniques, but what I am trying to say is that sometimes it’s good to look for a change and see if you like the result."
61,Welcome to the daily /r/Coffee question thread!
62,"There are no stupid questions here, ask a question and get an answer! We all have to start somewhere and sometimes it is hard to figure out just what you are doing right or doing wrong. Luckily, the /r/Coffee community loves to help out."
63,Do you have a question about how to use a specific piece of gear or what gear you should be buying? Want to know how much coffee you should use or how you should grind it? Not sure about how much water you should use or how hot it should be? Wondering about your coffee's shelf life?
64,"Don't forget to use the resources in our wiki! We have some great starter guides on our wiki ""Guides"" page and here is the wiki ""Gear By Price"" page if you'd like to see coffee gear that /r/Coffee members recommend."
65,"As always, be nice!"
66,"I’m brand spankin new to drinking coffee but after taking a trip to Hawaii and doing a coffee tour I was sold! We got a bag of peaberry coffee grown at the farm we bought the bag from in Hawaii and have ground the beans and used a French press to make our morning coffee! Yum! Well…we already went through that bag so yesterday I went out to find a new kind to try. We live in Alaska so….No one’s growing coffee up here of course, but I noticed that some bags say “proudly roasted in Alaska” but don’t say where the beans came from. And some bags will say “grown at ___ altitude, fair trade, ect..” but still don’t say where they come from. A few bags will say exactly what country and region. I’m not really sure it matters for anything practical but I am very curious about it! Is it just a bunch of beans from all over mixed together?"
67,Howdy! I've been experimenting with making cold brew in as little as 90 minutes with my magnetic stir plate and room-temperature water. It's nice for days when you need that afternoon cup.
68,"My current recipe is pour-over sized grounds (about 20:1 ratio) spinning for 90 minutes at medium speed (hard to quantify this, but there's a clear vortex formed in the liquid). Has anyone else experimented with a similar method?"
69,"A roaster has recommended a 1 minute steep in the Aeropress to get the best flavours out of a medium-dark bean. This is on a fine grind with a 1:16 ratio. I have never steeped for under 2.30. So, why is 1 minute being suggested? Will this bring out certain flavours and not others? The tasting notes BTW are blackberry compote, hazelnut, dark chocolate and orange zest. Using washed beans from Nicaragua. Thanks."
70,"I bought an Ethiopian natural from a small specialty roaster which looks to be quite lightly roasted. However, it has a strong smoky smell that I'd usually expect from dark, oily beans. I brewed 12:200 with a V60 at 93c and in the cup, there's a toasty cereal scent (sorry James...), an initial taste of smokiness that then gives way to some of the nice floral and berry sweetness before having a strong cigarette aftertaste. As it cools the smoky taste gets better, but that aftertaste still wobbles between berries and cigarettes (odd, I know). Does this sound like a roast defect or an issue with how I'm brewing it? I'm not smoking around it nor have I smoked cigs recently lol."
71,"Cheap grinders.   My Smart Grind Pro broke after 2 years.   The plastic impeller, (moves grinds away from burrs to container), wore down.   The second one had the same plastic impeller that wore down as well.   Breville has poor support.   Last time they offered me a small rebate on a new grinder.  This time they wanted me to send the grinder away and pay over $100 to get it repaired."
72,I'm trying Baratza this time because they sell replacement parts on their webpage.
73,"Edit:  as I've found out newer models replaced the plastic impeller blade with a stainless steal impeller blade.  So, after having my Smart Coffee Grinder fail after two years, Breville sold me another model off their website with the same faulty blade, and today the best they offer is a $100+ repair job."
74,Edit 2:  tbh I'm kind of surprised by the ratio.   It's an inferior product with known defects and poor support.  Just because they fixed the problem eventually doesn't mean they did not knowingly burn customers with a cheap machine.
75,This is a thread for the enthusiasts of r/Coffee to connect with the industry insiders who post in this sub!

81,I’m open to upgrading my grinder why am unsure if it’s worth it (just installed new burrs).
82,How can I tell how good my grinder is?
83,"Can someone explain me if what many roasters classify as filter or espresso roast for the same roast level (e.g. medium roast) is valid or just BS? I can't seem to understand what they mean by these ""profiles"" and it seems to a lot filter = light, espresso = dark with medium being a lottery."
84,does anyone have experience bringing automatic coffee grinders as domestic flight carry on luggage? picking up a mazzer mini from a friend and would rather carry on than checking it in.
85,this one: https://www.chriscoffee.com/products/mazzer-mini-espresso-grinder
86,"Last night I upgraded to the M2 Burr. I did it the ""easy"" way and found it to take about 10 minutes."
87,"My first step was to measure the time to grind. I did use some crummy, over-roasted coffee. I didn't want to use my precious self-roasted coffee because this was a night-time experiment."
88,Original M3 Burr:
89,Grind Setting: 20
90,Grams of Coffee: 20g
91,Time to Grind: 32 Seconds
92,M2 Burr:
93,"Grind Setting: 20 (I believe it's grinding finer at 20 now. I need to adjust. If it IS grinding finer at ""20"", that means this took even longer than an equally coarse grind)"

106,The Swilling Enfinigy Drip Coffee Maker Receives the SCA Certified Home Brewer Mark
107,Looks okay. I personally just bought the MoccaMaster one cup which I'm pretty happy with.
108,Hard to say where the SCA award sits and how it should be received. While the SCA is usually a pretty serious organisation trying to further the drinking of speciality coffee - without knowing the 'scientific standards' they require - it's hard not to see this as an advert with bells on.
109,Starbucks patent on 'Automated Personalized Beverage Distribution System' surfaces
110,"Pretty interesting patent here from Starbucks that was originally put together back in the summer, but only became public this week."
111,"The idea behind the invention is that a store can have one of these machines with numerous pumps and dispensers, and a menu with 100s of items made of combinations from the machine. The machine then helps the barista make the drink by lighting up the pumps in order. Apparently, these combinations include flavour, texture and colour (God help us all)."
112,This is part of a wider theme of coffee machine automation in coffee shops all over the world. The success of Blank Street Coffee has proved the model and Pret's shift towards automation is also part of the trend. This is likely driven by a combination of technology improvements and high labour costs.

114,Pour Speed - an Unexpectedly Big Pour Over Variable
115,How do you cup alone at home?
116,"Intelligentsia closes two more stores in Chicago, with three remaining, citing post-COVID era as source of troubled business"
117,"Hello,"
118,I modded my delonghi Dedica long time ago to have the other steam wand and it's been working great until now.
119,Yesterday I wanted to check if nothing is leaking so I opened it again but this time I accidentally opened 2 wrong screws which were the screws holding the end of the 2 thin hoses going to the espresso head.
120,It popped out and there was a cone shaped spring with a plastic ball on top in the middle of it. There is also an O-ring there.
121,"Since it popped out, I didn't manage to see the orientation the spring was inside."
122,I didn't take a picture of it but I will try to open it tomorrow again to take picture but maybe some of you know what I'm talking about until I do so. Here's an illustration of that: https://imgur.com/a/iH7WjVt
123,"I'm not sure I inserted the spring back in the right direction (although it seem the most logical way it goes inside), or if something else is causing the issue because now the machine has a problem:"
124,"When I put the portafilter and press the espresso button, the handle starts unscrewing itself as if there's too much pressure that pushes it out."
125,"Or, the problem is because I didn't screw something else tight enough and it's not holding the portafilter strong enough? There were a few long screws, few short and 1 a bit longer than all the others"
126,"When I left it unattended, the portafilter blew away with force (and broke the glass)"
127,Maybe I didn't put the screws in the correct place? (Some screws are longer and some are shorter)
128,Is there any manual for that? Last time I did it I took pictures of the screws location but this time I didn't and I don't have it anymore
129,Thanks
130,"I have been experimenting with how aggressively I pour water during my pulses. I'm using a Kalita Wave 185, Baratza Encore, and EKG gooseneck kettle. Keeping all other variables the same (grind size, water temp, size and frequency of pulses, height of the kettle over the brewer, etc.), I have been surprised to see that how strongly I pour the water can vary the brew time by almost a minute and a half. It started because I was fine-tuning my grind size for the wave (I got it as a Christmas gift). I locked in what I thought was the goldilocks grind for the brew time I was shooting for (also letting taste inform what I was doing). After about a week at that goldilocks grind size, by brew time started going down and down, until it hit about a minute and a half less than what I had been aiming for. After wracking my brain, and a little trial and error, I realized that the only thing that was different was that I was becoming more confident in the technique/recipe, so I wasn't babying the pour as much.  I wasn't pouring crazy aggressively or anything, but not babying it. Also wasn't changing the pour height. When I started focusing on a deliberately gentle pour again, not changing anything else, the time went back to my original target."
131,"TLDR, I didn't appreciate what a big variable pour strength/speed was, even with  a gooseneck kettle."
132,"What are your preferences? Do you try for a gentle pour, or do you just let the natural restriction of the gooseneck control pour speed?"
133,Hey everyone!
134,Welcome back to the weekly r/Coffee thread where you can share what you are brewing or ask for bean recommendations. This is a place to share and talk about your favorite coffee roasters or beans.
135,How was that new coffee you just picked up? Are you looking for a particular coffee or just want a recommendation for something new to try?
136,Feel free to provide links for buying online. Also please add a little taste description and what gear you are brewing with. Please note that this thread is for peer-to-peer bean recommendations only. Please do not use this thread to promote a business you have a vested interest in.
137,"And remember, even if you're isolating yourself, many roasters and multi-roaster cafes are still doing delivery. Support your local! They need it right now."
138,So what have you been brewing this week?
139,"Hey all,"
140,"Recently gotten into home brewing, and last weekend I did my first little cupping experiment. I have a very basic grinder, Hario Skerton (yes I've already noticed grind is pretty inconsistent, will probably upgrade soon)."
141,"To learn about effect of diff. grind sizes, I made the same Sidamo ethiopian with 3 grind sizes. Each cup with 6g of freshly ground beans, 100ml boiling water on top. Wait about 4min, remove crust then wait another few minutes."
142,"The test was super interesting, I could really feel how the finer grind gave a more bitter, astringent taste. And the coarser one had way more acidity!"
143,"I'd like to keep doing these tests, maybe with even more cups per test, but every time it's a lot of coffee to drink by myself (I'm quite sensitive to caffeine). Can I go lower than 6g per cup & still get good results? How do you guys go about it?"

159,"I see Technivorm makes models with a glass carafe & a thermal carafe. I've had a cheaper machine with a thermal carafe and found it much harder to clean, so I'm hesitant. I sense that the general consensus is to avoid hotplates like the plague, and I'm 50/50 on them: I had a Mr. Coffee in college that destroyed the coffee as fast as it brewed, but my family has had a cheap machine with a hotplate for years that, as far as I can tell, never greatly affected the flavor."
160,Anybody have experience with the glass Moccamaster?
161,"They way they did or even still do out on the trail. Some do pour overs, some do French press, some do percolator, and some do cowboy coffee."
162,Without electricity what is your favorite or best method. I also let mine sit for a while longer than recommended. I like a dark roast and bitter flavor.
163,I bought the Eureka Mignon Silenzio in chrome from an online retailer. The first one arrived and it had what looked like tarnishing on the body. The retailer were helpful and got it collected and they sent a new one out.
164,The replacement arrived today and it also has similar tarnishing as well as small chips on the body.
165,Is this a common problem with the chrome version? Has anyone experienced these issues?
166,"I bought a pound of Ethiopian Sidamo at a farmers market from a different roaster than my norm. When I opened the bag they were a very light golden brown color with a light aroma. I thought it did not look right, but I decided to grind some. Grinding them in my Baratza Encore took about 5 minutes for 30 grams of beans and I needed to clean out my grinder after. Normally, 30 grams of beans will grind in about  2 minutes."
167,"Any thoughts on how to resolve this issue? Should I attempt to roast the beans further (today I found un-roasted beans)? I am concerned about burning out the motor in my grinder, should I be? Thank you in advance."
168,Edit: I used a stopwatch and timed my Encore grinding 35 g of Brazilian Minas Gerais beans at a medium/fine grind (14). It took 1 minute 19 seconds.
169,Edit: I had a long conversation with the roaster who acknowledged that the beans were under-roasted and offered to grind the beans and give me another pound of coffee. We are planning to meet up at his cafe early next week for a cup of coffee as well.
170,"TL;DR: changing methods made my kettle temperature drop alot by accident, which made me realize how much temperature matters (after I measured the drop using a thermometer), started brewing at 90c, went from good to amazing cups."
171,I have a feeling this post might sound so obvious and stupid for some but this realization took my almost 2 years.
172,"Throughout I've tried a bunch of different beans, different methods, different waters, roast levels, grind size, ratios, recipes, timings, different everything. And I've never managed to get a cup of coffee that didn't have that ""coffee bitterness"", of course I just accepted it, because at the end of the day, coffee IS bitter."
173,"It took me around 12 months of daily special coffee consumption to get over sugar so I expected to get used to some bitterness in the same manner. But I never go over the feeling of ""I think I'm missing something""."
174,"I also never found a good and cheap 127v temperature controlled kettle, so I kept using my ancient gas stove one. I've been a bunch of people saying I should just go for boiling at it shouldn't matter much, and sure, makes sense so I never questioned it."
175,"A few months ago, Lance Hedrick posted a video about this pourover method that had a 2min bloom, and I thought it was the weirdest thing ever, but gave it a try anyway. My first cup was so drastically different it got me curious and it quickly became my go-to method."
176,"The last few weeks I've been getting into homebrewed beer, after some amazing experiences in some bars in my city. And you can find alot of information about how mash/fermentation temperature is important to get a good tasting beer."
177,"I have multiple thermometers in my kitchen and got curious how hard it would be to hold constant water temperature (basically I was trying to figure out if I needed something to get a consistent mash temperature). For whatever reason I tried with coffee, it's not even close to the amount of water one would use in a homebrew bash."
178,"BUT HOLY SHIT, remember that I said Lance's method gave me a super different taste? Depending on the amount of water I put in my kettle, the temperature would drop 20c+ after the first pour. Why? Because I always rested my kettle on top of a giant cool granite countertop, and it TANKED my water temperature."
179,"Since then, I've been playing around 85~95c and I finally crossed that line from ""Good cup"" to ""Amazing cup"" brewing at 90c. Even my parents that hate coffee realized that my cups were MUCH better. That punchy bitterness was completely gone and the taste notes got stronger (I think it's just the bitterness not overpowering them)."
180,"I hate how much coffee ""got wasted"" but at the same time, this is the reason I got into coffee hehe."
181,"I've been staying consistently within about 3 seconds for my drain times on the v60, so when I tried different temps at the same grind size, I was surprised to see the flow slowed down drastically as water temp lowered. With 99 degrees C, I was getting about 2:25 brews, all the way down to 85 degrees draining at 2:58. My 85 degree cup tasted more extracted than my 95 degree cup, which kind of blew my mind."

183,"Hi Everyone,"
184,"I primarly drink lattes and so most of my focus is in that direction. However, I do like to have other tools at my disposal. I currently own a Clever and a Hario Mugen as well. I like the Mugen for light roasts, and since I am not really doing a daily focus on pour over, I went with the Mugen instead of the regular V60 since it's more forgiving."
185,"I like my clever too! I love the ability to do immersion if I want, plus it still produces a nice amount of clarity (I have Kingrinder K6 that I use for all my non-espresso methods, btw)."
186,"I previously owned an Aeropress that I liked a lot, but I had gotten rid of it years ago, way before I got a lot more ""into"" this hobby."
187,"Okay, all of this to say- the thing I think I miss out on with the Clever and Mugen is ""body."" I love the flavors of coffee and the clarity I can get with some of these methods is really cool. But sometimes I want a thicker mouthfeel. I'm like this way with whiskey too! Sometimes I want a super complex, multiple casked Scotch, but sometimes I want a thick bourbon that just more mouth coating."
188,"So- my question is, is French Press the only method to achieve this? Is it simply the metal filter? I find that the clever produces a cup with a bit more body than the Mugen- which makes sense since it's immersion- but it still doesn't come close to that oilyness I get out of a french press."
189,"I recently did James' recipe and I really liked it. I had no sludge, it was a pretty clean cup but it still that body, much more than my other methods. So is this the only way? The Espro is an interesting looking press, but does that not produce the same body as let's say a Bodum?"
190,"I apologize for the long rant here, just trying to provide full context. TL;DR: is the french press simply the only method that will give the most body, and is that strictly due to the nature of metal vs paper filter?"
191,Thanks so much for all your help!

217,"I got gifted a 1 kilo bag of arabica coffee (whole beans), ""medium lightly roasted for pour over / percolator"". I use a french press, so that fits."
218,"The taste is described as ""mild and spicy"" (in German, I hope I translated that correctly)."
219,I drank it some months ago at the place from the person who gifted it me. And it tasted really good.
220,"Now those particular (sealed) bags taste pretty ""burned""."
221,"I believe that it also smelled much more like chocolate, when I smelled it at the persons place some months ago."
222,"They say ""best before"" around November 2023. I don't know if they use the maximum (in Germany 2 years for coffee) or if they just say idk like ""1 year"" or something. But it's not fresh, that's for sure. There is no roast date (I can call them the next days and ask them) but it has to be at least 4 months old (if they would use 1 year) or up to 1 year 4 months (if they max out)."
223,"As a coffee enthusiast, I have never let the coffee sit on the kitchen shelf for that long and now I am wondering:"
224,"Might it be just poor quality (maybe a burned batch), or how does (a medium light roasted arabica) coffee change its taste over time?"
225,Hello!
226,"I'm trying to get decaffeinated coffee beans for a school science project, and my teacher recommended me to check out the Swiss Water Process (https://www.decadentdecaf.com/pages/about-swiss-water-decaf) for doing so at home (the ones available in the markets where I live have some sort of weight-loss substance added in them so I can't use them as they might interfere with the results of my experiment)."
227,"The Swiss Water Process seems simple enough (certainly more so than the other extraction methods involving organic compounds)- the only problem is that we need to filter out the caffeine from the GCE and I can't figure out how. Apparently there are some carbon / activated charcoal filters that have a specific pore size so that they filter out only caffeine, but I can't seem to find those anywhere (maybe because I don't know what those filters are called)."
228,"Anyone who knows the name of the filters or some other way to extract caffeine (from the GCE, not the green coffee beans)- I would really appreciate your help on this!! Thank you."
229,"Hi, i try to hit a perfect ratio, but as per title, sometimes i missed to stop my espresso brewing, and therefore it came out bitter over extracted. I always in the golden range 20-30s, for 1:2 ratio dose to yield. but sometimes, when you focus on the timer, you miss looking at the yield on the weigh scale. Anyone has any tips? i want to do get a better hold, so i can fine tune my coffee"

I caught my mistake about 15 g in and decided to simply switch the remaining coffee to pour over grind, I wound up with a mixed batch of grind and thought, “hey, why not” and dumped it all into the paper filter. Brewed it using my typical chemex technique (45 second bloom, all the water in one go)  and man did that turn into a really good cup of coffee."
250,"I need help finding an affordable way to grind coffee beans for espresso. Many web blogs suggest that espresso requires more than a coffee grinder for the house.  It seems like I have to spend over $500 on a good grinder for both drip and espresso. I bought fine ground coffee from some coffee vendors, but it wasn't fine enough for espresso. Is the commercial coffee grinder at the grocery store good for espresso? The grinder can be used with the condition that coffee beans must be purchased at the store."

266,My home uses well water but we have a reverse osmosis system in place and I'm using the James Hoffman v60 method (not single cup)
267,I have my grind size set to fine per the C2 recommendations.
268,"First brew I made was great, probably the best coffee experience I've ever had. The last 2 were good but more bitter or acidic than the first. I'm unsure if this is user error on my part (I use a scale so unsure what could have changed?) or if maybe I could get something more consistent with other variables controlled. I keep seeing mention of minerals in water, what all is recommended? Is reverse osmosis bad for brewing? Should I buy bottled water or buy minerals and add them to my water for home brewing? Could it be something else (method not good for this roast?)."
269,Thanks for all advice!
270,"EDIT: I forgot to mention, we have RO water as our well water has a sulfuric/egg smell to it. It has been tested before with no indications of sulfur or iron, results came back drinkable. We even bleached the well and use salt to soften the water and that usually helps but unsure if the water quality would be any better for brewing."
271,I was wondering how espresso is made on an Industrial scale for things like tiramisu or those plastic bottles of coffee you find at the grocery store.

278,"There is no FDA standard for espresso, so for all we know it could be warm tap water with an old sock in it."

282,"I really have been enjoying my Hario switch size 03 lately using a method similar to the clever brewer method James Hoffmann covered, but I’m looking for a way to brew a larger volume with similar results. My current method:"
283,Hario V60 filters rinsed with water just off boil with switch closed until the brewer heats up. Discard the rinse water.
284,Add 300 grams water to brewer with switch closed.
285,Add 19 gram freshly ground coffee.
286,Stir just enough to wet grounds.
287,Immersion brew for two minutes.
288,"Break the surface to let grounds settle. After 20-30 seconds, open the switch and let the brewer drain entirely."
289,The immersion brewing aspect of this really makes the method foolproof. Very little need to dial-in and if I forget about it and let it run too long before draining it still turns out great.
290,How can I best adapt this method to 600-900 mL while still retaining the foolproof and effortless aspects of my current method? Three options I’m considering:
291,"A, pour over then immersion: Perform steps 1- 4 with the full amount of coffee. Add as much water as the brewer can hold, stir, then open the switch. Brew in pour over mode with the switch open until all the water is delivered with a full brewer. Close the switch and the proceed with immersion brewing for 2 minutes (steps 5-6)."
292,"B, immersion then pour over: Perform steps 1-5 with the full amount of coffee and the max water that the brewer will allow. Open with switch and add the remaining water in pour over mode."
293,"C, double immersion: Perform steps 1-6 with the full amount of coffee and half the total water. After the first half of water drains, repeat with the second half."
294,"I’m shying away from B, because the water in the brewer will cool down and cause the second water addition to not be as hot."
295,Any reason to be worried about over/under extraction with A or C?

299,Recently I have been brewing more pour overs and getting annoyed by the microfines over extracting as my brew generally taste good but theres always that annoying hint of overextraction.
300,"I recently watched a Lance Hendrick video where he mentioned an experiment that showed people to notice a difference of 5 degrees celsius in espresso, but not 3 degrees. I'm wondering is there a certain number of microns that is noticeable? Like when I'm adjusting my grind size for a brew, is one 22-micron click going to make ANY noticeable difference? Or should I go for 3, or 5, or maybe more."
301,"Yes, I could do an experiment myself and try to do a blind tasting with identical cups numbered on the bottom and blah blah, no I'm not doing that lol"
302,"So since I'm the only Coffee drinker in my household I thought it would be exagerrating to buy a big electric grinder. Reading about the Porlex, praised as one of the best hand grinders, I chose to get one of those instead."
303,"Since then my Coffee tastes bad: bitter, sludgy, just off. I replaced my old French Press, blamed it on the beans. But then I realized: It's the freaking Porlex."
304,"The grind is all over the place. So many fines, I could paint pictures with it. Coarse pieces that I could wear around my neck. This thing cost me 70 bucks, why would anyone recommend it?"
305,So what are your experiences with it? Is there a way to fix this thing or can you recommend small electric grinders / other alternatives? And does grinding fresh yourself really matter that much if you can get small batches of home-roasted beans every week from your local roaster?
306,"I experimented with a vast range of ""clicks"" aka grind-size, from 40 to 8 and it does get better towards the finer size, but is still awful. I grind slowly and with one hand, on the table."
307,"I'd like to better understand the in the cup difference between Washed and Naturals. I think it'd be a very fun experiment to try them side by side of the same crop. I can't imagine I'm the only person who's thought of this, but I'm guessing most (all?) growers go strictly with one of the other. But, I figure if this does exist, then this community would know where I could find it."
308,"Barring that, I'd be interested in other coffee recommendations to contrast the differences between washed and natural."
309,"I've been doing this for a while now, and this morning i found myself thinking i was 'finally almost through this bag' which i then almost immediately felt bad about, as i hadn't really experimented with it at all."
310,"Some context: i enjoy shopping around and getting new beans almost every time, the rare occasion i'll enjoy something so much to buy a 2nd or 3rd time (aside from a year or two stint where i was loyal to a local roaster until they were sold and the quality declined). there's a lot out there, a lot of talented folk growing and roasting coffee, and i want to experience as much of it as possible. i generally know what flavor profiles i prefer, but also enjoy trying new types."
311,"Now that i'm experienced in all the brewers and variables at my disposal, i find myself losing interest pretty much right off the bat if a coffee doesn't show some promise."
312,"Always start out brewing in a V60, and depending on how that goes, assign to a different method or plan to try tweaking for the next brew. But occasionally there will be the bag that i can't theoretically find any promise in and it becomes a slog to get through. In the past i've still experimented with these bags, but never was able to save one, so i've mostly quit doing that.There was once a while ago with one such bag that was brought back to life by a mocha pot, but that was before i had used the mocha pot very much."
313,"Am i just jaded? overcome by ego? or is this just something that happens with experience? I guess i'm just looking for some hope, or confirmation, or someone to knock me down a peg. would be happy with any/all of the above. i know that some flavors just ""aren't for me"" but is it really possible to figure that out with a single brew? should i just quit trying flavor profiles that i'm ""fairly certain"" aren't my thing? i don't think that can be it, because even beans from the same place change over time."
314,"Small aside: i keep saying 'flavors' and 'flavor profiles'. just to clarify, in my head, that's a combination on what i know of the 1) region, 2) roast 3) process and lastly, with a grain of salt, 4) the flavor profile listed on the roaster's description."
315,"Generally in life i hold a ""never stop learning"" mindset, but it seems like with coffee i've reached the end of personally useful knowledge, with the exception of doing something i really can't afford like buying an espresso machine."
316,"Also, reading back over this it sounds a littly braggy. it probably is, but i'm not saying i'm the best coffee brewer in the world now or anything. i've just found what works for me. great chance if i served a cup of my coffee to a World Barista Championship judge, they'd spit it back in my face."

Sometimes I forget and it steeps a little longer, but I'm still happy. The 30 grind size means it drains super fast especially with the water-first hack."
332,"Is it perfect? Maybe not but it brews enough for two and I have been happy with the coffee. I'm not the pickiest though. I also really don't like when it's too acidic, so my palette leans away from that side of things."
333,Just wanted to share the recipe for any other beginners out there struggling to get tasty coffee.
334,"So, it's really the 30:30:3:3"
335,"Obviously you're suppose to do a swirl/stir at the start of the brew, but ever since I've started swirling my v60's intermittently throughout the brew, I've gotten much more cleaner and less astringent brews."
336,"I thought it made sense to keep swirling considering the whole premise of coffee brewing is based on evenness, so I thought this was the best way to achieve that and avoid channeling."
337,Is there a reason I shouldn't be doing this?
338,"It seems like a lot of the best coffee tech, and many well-known, companies are based in Taiwan. I have a Q2 1zpresso and I'm looking into getting a Clever dripper. I notice both of these companies are Taiwan based, as well as other coffee gear companies like Kin Grinder, and also more niche companies like WAFO. Does Taiwan have a long-standing culture around coffee the way Italy does? If this is a more recent development, what's driving it? Asking as someone, who already thinks Taiwan is a pretty neat country."
339,"Who else remembers 2012 Ethiopians being Blueberry bombs, or Kenyans having Grapefruit acidity? I feel like in recent years coffee from Ethiopia has been super delicate, floral, which is also enjoyable, but some days I am craving the fruit bomb of a washed Ethiopia from a decade ago."

346,"So TDS Stands for total dissolved solids and is used commonly by the Coffee community to measure ""extraction yield"" in percentages, or similiar."
347,"The meter itself, as far as I know, measures the samples conductivity, especially focussing on dissolved/dissociated metal cations. A review on another tool, which may be more interesting because of it's higher specificity, has been done by James Hoffmann (the Coffein Meter)."
348,"My point is, that in my mind, metal cations could as well be from the metal used in boiling the water, burrs grinding the (slightly acidic Coffee), paper Filters, and other stuff. Of course, you probably could calibrate your device with such data, tho I wonder how much these variables are dependend on external factors, therefore a calibration being close to useless. Also, I don't see anybody publishing their calibration results..."

359,"Back in August, I made a post where I reviewed a bunch of decaf coffees I'd tried and gave my ranking. In the comments, people offered up a ton of recommendations for other decafs to try. While I didn't get to try them all, I did try a whole bunch."
360,"As I wrote last time, Swiss Water Processed decafs always taste off--that opinion has been reinforced by this recent tasting.  I won't write them off completely--so, if you have a recommendation that you think might change my mind, definitely drop it in a comment.  Sugarcane/Ethyl Acetate decaffinated coffee is still the best, imo."

364,"Olympia | Asterisk, San Sebastian, Colombia | Caturra | EA"
365,"An excellent decaf. It has an wonderful, juicy acidity and none of the usual markers of a decaf. It does lack in the complexity and intrigue you might expect of a similarly bright, yet caffienated, coffee, but that's a minor gripe. There's a chance that when tasted alongside an ""OK"" third wave coffee, I wouldn't be able to identify the decaf one."
366,"Counter Culture | Urcunina, Nariño, Colombia | EA"
367,"A really surprising decaf. Whole bean in the bag, I could smell the ""decaf-ness"" of it, but once brewed that smell went away. The taste of the decaffeination is well-hidden by an abundance of acidity. Like most decafs, it's fairly one-note, but the note is clear, bright, and sustained."
368,"B&W | Gedeb, Yirgacheff, Ethiopia | EA"
369,"Somewhat acrid, but mellowed out by an extremely round and full body. You couldn't fool me with this, but it's reasonably pleasant."
370,Equator | Ethiopia Alemu Tukule Natural | SW
371,"One of the better SWP decafs I've had. However, it's a bit sharp around the edges and still carries that je ne sais quois that SWP always has that marks it like a flaming beacon as decaf (and in particular SWP)."
372,Theory | Peru | SW
373,"I'm becoming a real decaf conniseur--I was able to identify the process just by smelling it. Luckily, the smell wasn't terribly strong, which boded well. The smell of SWP persists in the brew, but the taste is actually quite nice. There's a really bright acidity that I've never found in an SWP. Unfortunately, the decaf-mustiness is still there, and there isn't a ton of complexity. Still, not bad at all. Definitely an excellent choice."
374,Counter Culture | Slow Motion (LATAM) | SW
375,"The bag's self-description is fairly accurate—it tastes of cocoa and molasses. But it also tastes of something the bag does not state: Swiss Water Processing. It's fine, for a coffee-flavored tea."
376,"Alright, that's the list! If you have any recommendations for more great decaf to try, let me know! I probably won't get around to a part 3 for quite some time as I'm travelling atm, but when I'm back to my equiptment I'll try what ya'll suggest."

378,"Normally I don't engage with the comments section, but someone said to always use distilled water in your espresso machine and I couldn't resist. Drawing on my (admittedly limited) knowledge of chemistry, distilled water has no ions and would strip the minerals out of the machine's metal components, causing them to degrade over time. (I didn't mention anything about taste since that's subjective and I didn't want to muddy the waters.) But he threw a curveball when he replied that nothing will leach out of stainless steel and that most coffee makers have stainless steel components."
379,"Any chemists on here that can speak to that? Getting mixed results when I search the internet, so I designed my own home experiment with stainless steel spoons. One spoon is in distilled water (measured at 000 PPM) in a plastic bowl and one spoon is in the same type of bowl with filtered water (150 PPM). Identical spoons, identical bowls. If the distilled water degrades the spoon faster than the filtered water, then I'd expect the 000 PPM reading to increase at some point."
380,I'm also open to being proven wrong. Maybe taste is the only concern...
381,"My Aeropress recipe used to be pretty much what James Hoffmann showed in his series: Grind pretty fine (in terms of medium); couple of clicks finer than a 1-cup V60 is what I'd usually do. Steep for about 2 mins, swirl, wait 30sec, press. Pretty tasty."
382,"I've read here and there (e.g. Jonathan Gagné) that steeping for much longer can lead to really good results. Now I was wondering if it makes sense to grind coarser for such a recipe than for a ""standard"" recipe. Because 4 minutes plus steep the coffee is already pretty nicely extracted (as it would be in a French Press) and then grinding finely for the press doesn't really make sense or does it? I'd guess it only makes channeling more likely."
383,Do you agree? Does it make sense to grind coarsely (like a normal medium filter grind or so) for a long-steep method?
384,"Ive recently jumped down the coffee rabbit hole. My grinder is the DBM8 which is producing a good amount of fines. I experimented with sifting the coffee grounds to eliminated some of the fines. Its worked well and i can get a great cup of coffee,only draw back is 15-20% of the coffee is being lost as fines. I have been bagging up the fines of my expensive coffees wondering if there is a good use for them? I was thinking of maybe making a hacked cappuccino or latte in a french press but not sure if the fines are too small to use in the FP. any ideas? I wondered if say a 1:3 ratio in the FP to produce a strong coffee and then rinse the FP to froth some milk. I am not sure if the fines are going to over extract in the FP. If anyone has any experience sifting fines and what they do with them as they accumulate let me know!"
385,"UPDATE: I got bored and did go ahead and experiment... not expecting much. I ended up mixing a ratio of 3:1 fines to water. Stirred up well in French press and let it extract for just 2 mins since the coffee was quite fine.. I was able to get about 1/3 ""hack espresso"" out of the brewer. In my case I mixed 30g fines to 90g water snd got around 40g out."
386,I then heated milk slowly to 160f and used my FP to froth it up about double its original volume and dumped around 200g  over the coffee for a 5:1 milk/coffee ratio.
387,Besides the coffee being extremely gritty. It actually tasted much better than I thought. Of course it wasnt what you would get from a coffee shop but it was enjoyable.
388,I also did get my baratza encore a few days ago ans it produces a more consistent grind with less fines than the old dbm8 .I'm just going to use thr encore  not worry much about sifting unless I just want to nerd out randomly.
389,Happy Valentine's Day lovely people. I like my coffee how I like my relationships - literally I will settle for anything.
390,Victoria Arduino release their new restaurant-focused Eagle Tempo
391,VA are doing God's work and putting out some really gorgeous cough wait no interesting machines at the moment and the Eagle Tempo genuinely does come at the end of a run of releases.
392,The Eagle Tempo is focused on restaurants looking for consistent coffee without a highly trained barista. This segment of the industry has existed for year but was sometimes neglected and seen as outside of 'speciality' coffee.

409,"I'm very torn about which way to go with this. Like sports, coffee should easily transcend language and speak for itself. However, the WBC has established a tradition of baristas explaining their process and ingredients to judges. It's as practical as it is principled to change this now."
410,"The calls to include Spanish are well-meaning and understandable but they won't be in the end, and perhaps nor should they be. Although Spanish is the main language spoken in many coffee producing countries, Portuguese would certainly have to be included."
411,This would be further complicated by deaf and HOH competitors sign sign languages differ globally.
412,"In order to accommodate other languages, the WBC would need to substantially change its format. Personally, that seems like the most reasonable approach for the longevity and success of the tournament. If competitors are allowed to submit explanations in advance which are translated for judges, then performances are done without commentary - let the coffee speak for itself."
413,"Also, I'm not sure 'explaining your process' is really a core barista skill that I've seen in any cafe."
414,"While I was rooting about on Victoria Arduino's website, I found that they have a series of quite good Spotify playlists"
415,Wondering if anyone has some insight on this. When I brew 1 cup V60 with light roasted beans from my preferred roaster I get great results with a drawdown time of 3 - 3:30 minutes. I follow James Hoffman's technique with just off the boil water and use a grind size of ~20 with a Comandante C40.
416,"However I bought ""single origin"" beans from a different roaster and they look and smell darker roasted than what I normally work with. During the bloom phase all the water runs through extremely quickly and I get a drawdown time of less than 2:30 minutes. The resulting cup tastes watered down and gross. Any help or experience would be appreciated."
417,"I had a thought yesterday about my morning coffee fix when I’m undertaking multi day adventures (cycling & running). The disciplines require a super lightweight set up, and will be in remote places so camping equipment to brew a coffee isn’t ideal."

428,"I'm curious about countries which grow coffee, but it is not readily available and not as talked about in the community. For example, I heard that Yemen coffee is top tier, but since there's an ongoing war in the country there's just no way to export it. Can anyone confirm or deny it, or maybe someone tasted it?"
429,Also today I stumbled upon Jamaican coffee online. Is it any good?
430,Maybe there are other countries that you know which have coffee but it's not so widespread around the world for some reason?
431,"Hi guys! I finally got some countertop space and I am ready to buy an amazing flat-burr grinder!I want a grinder that can ensure the best quality grind out there, without unnecessarily breaking the bank toooo hard.  I care about the UX part of it slightly, but really what is important to me is the grind quality.In my searches I stumbled accross the Lagom P64. I like the design of it, and the fact that it comes with SSP burrs is very nice. However, I saw it only has a 64mm burr.I read that bigger burrs will last longer and grind faster, which is sort of obvious. Besides that, some websites claim that a bigger burr will also grind better. Is this true? It's not obvious to me how burr size would influence grind quality..."
432,"There's also the weber EG1 of course, which also has the bigger burrs, or the Lagom P100, but they are much pricier. Considering that I won't be able to sleep at night knowing that there's a home-use grinder that grinds better than mine, should I go bankrupt and buy a Lagom P100/weber EG1/Something else with big bad SSP burrs, or should I stay with the smaller, cheaper but still powerful Lagom P64?"
433,"I just got a bag of anaerobic natural process Ethiopian from Red Rooster.  I really like most of the flavors. It’s super fruity and a little chocolatey and unlike any coffee I’ve had before. I’ve been using an Aeropress. The first few brews had a distinct balsamic vinegar flavor, but I’ve since gotten rid of that by adjusting the recipe. Now I’m getting good cups, but it has a red wine note that I’m not a fan of. Is there anything I can try to mellow it out a little? Maybe resting it for a few more days?"
434,"Disclaimer: I posted this to r/AeroPress, but for some reason it doesn't show up in the feed and reddit doesn't even show me post insights, so I don't know what is happening, but that post is shadow banned for some reason. I'll post it here to more general audience. OK, now the post..."
435,"Hello everyone, I got AeroPress recently and I was experimenting with parameters a lot. I make 1 coffee every day, so it takes time. I am using the guide from James Hoffmann on YouTube as basis and adjusting it to find what works."
436,"I use very good kettle (Fellow Stagg EKG) so I can adjust that to exact value. I also have good grinder (Porlex Mini 2) and good scale. I like to be very precise in general so no eyeballing here. I should also probably mention that I make a lot of tea every day, which is where most of my base knowledge about brewing comes from. I am used to adjusting parameters, I just don't know what works for coffee yet."
437,Questions:
438,"How much coffee should I use? Everywhere I look, I see 11-15g per cup (200-250ml) and it tastes fine to me, but whenever I try to make coffee for someone they insist it tastes like water. My brother uses 20g for 200ml. I tried 17g and 20g and I have noticed the coffee is stronger, but the flavors are less pronounced. Is this normal? Am I doing something wrong? Should I adjust other parameters like grind size or temperature? Should I aim to use less coffee with high quality beans to emphasize flavor and more beans with cheap beans since it has less flavor to begin with?"
439,"How should I use stirring? I tried ignoring it, stirring before I put the top part of AeroPress on, and I tried swirling. I am not sure but stirring seems to make coffee bitter, I'll need to experiment more. How do you do it?"
440,"And lastly, my parents have an espresso machine and have been using it for years. I used to dring latte with them, but recently when I got more into coffee, I tried the coffee without milk and it tastes... really bad, bitter at first, than sour as it cools down. Is this normal? I would like to try to improve it. When I asked about parameters, they grind the coffee very finely and use high temperature setting. They buy heavily roasted coffee. If I was making that in AeroPress, I would use coarse grind and low temperature, so the opposite of what they do. So what is the relation here? Do the same parameter adjustments apply to espresso brewing?"

446,"I read several good reviews about this machine, including on Seattle Coffee Gear, which convinced me to give it a try."
447,"While the machine is nice to look at and purports to offer several different drink types, they all taste very similar and are very much on the under extracted, sour, and undrinkable side."
448,I have long trusted Seattle Coffee Gear. They raved about this machine. Maybe everything has changed now that Gail has retired.
449,"I sent it back after 3 days and 30+ attempts at making something drinkable. I went 0 for 30. It's really that bad. Aeropress, french press, moka pot, Moccamaster all make significantly better coffee than the Spinn."
450,I guess it really is just for people who think Keurig tastes pretty good and want to spend their money on something that is more of a tech gadget than a serious coffee machine.

471,"So I’ve been in a cycle of pour over, aeropress and French press with my auto drip in between for a while."
472,"I love the non auto methods (no issue with drip either), especially the rituals of each process."
473,"However, on work days I’ve just found that the time I’m spending on those methods isn’t conducive for a productive morning."
474,Recently I’ve settled into using my auto drip during the week and French press on my days off.
475,"I like consistency so I buy high quality beans available at most National groceries: stumptown, intelligentsia, counter culture etc…  and grind them myself."
476,I weigh water and use that weight to calculate the weight of beans for a given batch. I use purified water always for my coffee.
477,The results have been great. However…
478,Several days ago I saw a post on Instagram where someone suggested blooming your auto drip beans.
479,"So I started incorporating the method into my drip coffee routine. Water, double the weight of the beans, heated in my electric kettle. Pour over the beans, wait 40 seconds and turn the machine on."
480,The results have been stunning. As good or better than any drip I’ve had at any of our local coffee shops.
481,And I’m not brewing acid bombs that seem to be the go-to profile at most coffee shops these days.
482,The best part is that adding blooming to my auto drip routine adds little time to the process.
483,If you haven’t bloomed your auto drip coffee before I highly recommend it.
484,"I buy from a local roaster in my area. I find their coffee to be quite enjoyable, and I use a Chemex with a Hario Skerton hand grinder. Given that the grinder has no ""settings"" per say, just a giant screw, I'd say my beans are always like a slightly course table salt."
485,"My wife just got back from Panama and brought me a bag of coffee from there. Using the exact same setting as I use for my ""normal beans"" on the Hario, the beans came out much finer and they seemed softer/easier to grind. I've never really noticed the grind consistency changing with different beans -- just that some are easier to grind than others."
486,"Have I completely lost the plot, or is there something about these Panamanian beans that could be throwing me off a bit? (e.g. fresher/softer?)"

488,Lance just dropped his latest video on the history of home espresso machines. In this video he takes a look at some of the first domestic espresso machines.
489,"I received an Ethiopian Yirgacheffe from Anodyne Coffee 3 or 4 days after roast (This was mid January). For the first week or so it was extremely tea-like and floral. It was more tea-like than I really wanted, and I tried different brew methods and ratios to get more body out of it. I used a v60, Clever Dripper, and Aeropress with the John Gange method producing the best result, but still not being my favorite. I gave it to my dad to drink. He's no coffee nerd, but he said it tasted roasty and dark, which I found odd given my experience of it."
490,"Anyway, about 3 weeks later, I needed some coffee so I grabbed the bag and made it in my v60, expecting it to be very light and it tastes extremely roasty and the floral notes are gone. I've made it 2 or 3 times to make sure it wasn't my mistake, and no, it's flavor has changed dramatically; it tastes like a totally different coffee."
491,"I know coffee will degass and change as it ages, but I've never experienced this drastic of a change before. Has anyone else experienced this? Is this a Ethiopian Yirgacheffe variety thing?"
492,"I should preface this by saying that I know all the usual caveats for WAC recipes. They're not practical for everyday home brewing, they're tuned to a specific coffee, they're made for a specific water composition, so on and so forth. I get that I can't expect to plug a given WAC recipe in for any coffee and get something magical from it. I don't really even care to try."
493,"Rather, I'm curious about a very specific trend in WAC top flight recipes. Everything that I know (or think that I know) about making coffee indicates that it's ideal to chase the highest level of extraction possible without extracting ""tannins"". Everything that I (think I) know about brewing with an AeroPress indicates that maximizing extraction means grinding as fine as possible without causing channeling, using a relatively low dosage of coffee (e.g. 1:16), using very hot water, and steeping for as long as is feasible."
494,"But basically every WAC top finisher for years now has done the exact opposite of all of this. They almost all seem to grind very coarse (they previously ranked the coarseness 1-10 where 1 is very fine and 10 very coarse, and it seems that 8/10 was the most common ranking given), use relatively cool water (80C is common, anything over 90C is rare, almost nobody ever uses 100C), steep for less time than the competition rules seem to allow them (almost universally brew times of less than two minutes), and most mystifyingly to me, use enormous doses of coffee (typically nothing lower than 1:11 even after dilution, and as high as 1:3 during the brew)."
495,"I'm just an amateur, but like I said, that's all nearly the exact opposite of what I've been taught results in good extraction. It seems like most WAC recipes would result in a wildly underextracted cup. This goes way beyond brews suited to a particular coffee - at first glance from my untrained eyes, it looks like most recipes go against what I thought were generally good brewing principles."
496,"So why are so many of them like that? Am I fundamentally misunderstanding something about extraction and flavour, or is there something about the WAC tournament environment that adds context which I'm missing?"
497,I have an old Hamilton Beach FlexBrew 49988 (address below so you can see) that I think has finally given up the ghost today. And unfortunately that model is no longer available nor can I seem to find anything quite like it.
498,"On one side it was designed for single serve travel cups/mugs, the other for straight hot water."
499,"I drink both coffee and tea, but never a lot at once so this had been perfect. No wasted carafe and I didn't need to worry about about loose coffee grounds getting into the tea (which often happens when I use the Keurig at work)."

504,I'd like to compare the level of fines between my grinders and am  wondering how to normalize grind level between them. Would the following  protocol be accurate/useful enough?
505,"Dial in a shot of espresso so that each grinder produces the same  shot time with the same amount of coffee (e.g. 30 sec, 10 gram in, 20  gram out)."
506,Grind the same amount of coffee at this grind level and transfer into  a 250 micron sieve. Shake for a minute and measure the weight.
507,Attach a battery-powered blower and a custom cap to the sieve (see  comment below) in order to apply air pressure to blow out more fines.  Measure the weight.
508,"I tried this with a friend's Kingrinder K4, grind level set to 46 clicks. Here are the results:"
509,Slowly cranking (about 80 RPM)
510,Initial ground coffee weight: 10.13 gram (includes RDT)
511,After 1 minute of shaking: 9.20 gram

514,Initial ground coffee weight: 10.08 gram (includes RDT)
515,After 1 minute of shaking: 7.86 gram

518,Currently new to the speciality coffee. I use aeropress to brew at home. I'm more into light roasted coffees and mostly all of them taste the same to me. Need suggestions as to how can I develop the palate
519,I was sensing a lot of bitterness in my coffee (AP or V60) and came to the conclusion the culprit might be fines.
520,My grinder is Timemore Slim.
521,I decided to try and sift fines from the coffee using a common kitchen sieve. I weighed my standard dose (12 grams) and ground it relatively coursely (ca.18-19 clicks).
522,I was shocked with the result.
523,"2.3 grams is basically 20%. And even visually, that's a massive amount. On my fingers it really felt like a very fine coffee powder - perhaps not as fine as supermarket-bought espresso pack but still."
524,What do I do now (before changing grinders:-/). I tried the alignment test (rotating the grinder body whilst only holding the handle) and it seemed to me it was rotating freely at around 9 clicks. I feel like that's not perfect but it's not terrible either. Understand 8 is really good already.
525,Any recommendations?

528,"Although there has been a long, and one way, love affair between coffee and wine for at least a hundred years - I don’t think this a sommelier stick-em-up*."
529,"As to my understanding, aerating coffee before you drink will make subtle notes more perceptible and reduce some of the bitterness and harshness."
530,"This 8-cup Chemex has small indents (""paddles"") on the inside which may steadily aerate the coffee as it’s swirled within. I understand that this is similar to decanter but, personally, I am no expert on the grape."
531,Baratta Release the Encore ESP(resso)
532,"You wait three months for a pun-based name, then two come along at once."
533,"Certainly the original Encore is a popular all-rounder, mid price, home grinder and the promise of the ESP is to allow casual home users greater control of their dialling in process."
534,"The most important change which Baratza have made is an internal gearing system which reduces down the relationship between the setting wheel and the internal distances, only once the espresso range has been reached on that dial."
535,This should allow for closer adjustments when grinding on the finest settings while keeping big jumps for filter and pour over.

The original disk seemed too big so I remodelled it to fit the Baratza Encore without removing the wing nut. According to Niche, it's supposed to create a more consistent flow of beans to the burrs to prevent popcorning and improve grind consistency. I've been getting good results using it."
560,Here is what it looks like:  https://imgur.com/KEyMnpaHere is the model: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5826392Pourover without disk:  https://imgur.com/TOiRlOWPourover with disk: https://imgur.com/pxzcMO6
561,Does anyone have experience with this or have any suggestion on how to improve the disk further?
562,"Just thought I'd throw this out there.  I'm returning my ode v2.  The static issue is not mitigated.  It might be better than the V1, but after a couple weeks of daily use, there are grounds literally everywhere."
563,"The bigger issue is the feeding.  The slope is still inadequate, but even when beans are all the way down into the hole leading to the grind chamber, it just doesn't grind."
564,"And in the rare event that it does grind, it will just stop mid dose."
565,This thing is so bad.
566,"Fellow's response was to 'grind less beans' even though I'm using less than the recommended ratio for brewing in my Moccamaster, and only using slightly more than half of the hopper's 100g capacity.  They also said to switch to a light roast which has smaller beans."
567,"I'm sorry, but if your response is to 'grind less' and to switch your roast, that's not an acceptable solution to a $350 grinder."
568,Now I'm just mad I sold my Baratza Sette 270 before realizing how bad the Ode V2 is.
569,EDIT: Here is how almost every grind attempt goes: https://youtube.com/shorts/J49862udIGI
570,"I've been realising that there are loads of eponymous names in coffee techniques - like Weiss distribution tool, Stockfleth move, Staub tamping, Kasuya 6:4 etc."
571,Sounds a lot like medicine/surgery where nearly all surgical instruments are named after a person.
572,Can you think of other eponymous names in coffee?
573,"I forgot the name of the machine but it is similar to this one on the left side with 2 slots. Ive only worked there 2 times since I've just started but when pushing the lever to let the espresso flow, its takes around 10 seconds."
574,Ive worked in an other coffee bar the last 6 months and learned quite a bit about coffee - one thing being the fact that the machines they used there (modern barista machines) take 27 seconds for the espresso to finish and that it is crucial to adjust the grain size if its below 22 or over 32 seconds. they explained the coffee extraction time to me and showed me these charts. looking at them its kind of obvious that everything under 15 seconds is under-extracted.
575,"so now Ive worked in the new place twice and made an espresso and was very surprised to see it come out that fast. can an espresso shot be good if the coffee extraction is that short? maybe its different with old machines, I dont know."

584,Trouble dialing in Costa Rica Las Lajas V60
585,"EU moccamaster hotplate, lengthen auto-off"
586,"Was watching [this video](https://youtube.com/watch?v=d3pTpXvdo4E) last night and in it he low key mentioned wrapping the  bolt that adjusts the grind size with plumbers tape, which eliminates wobble at the bearing that stabilizes the rotating burr. When you take off the front plate you can manually wobble the bearing prior to this mod."
587,The process is very simple. If you have [zeroed the grinder](https://youtube.com/watch?v=irzMw4UcTfY) before you can do this. When you expose the adjustment dial just unscrew it all of the way. I wrapped 4 layers of the plumbers tape around the threads. Then just reassemble. You can feel the tighter tolerance and the bearing no longer wobbles. Made aligning the burrs slightly less painful.
588,"I've owned a Gaggia Gran Deluxe for almost five years. In the beginning I could get a perfect layer of crema, my shots were flavourful, and I got the right consistency with the steam wand for whichever Milk texture I was after. After some time, the steam wand seemed to not be able to create those textures. I was pretty sure that my shots seemed to be watery. Did some research and apparently this could have been because I was not tampering properly. I began to put around 10kg force and made sure to keep it level. Seemed to solve it at the time."
589,"Fast forward another year and the shots are somewhat cooler. There's a one in three chance of my shots becoming watery and bland. Water leaks from the machine. The weirdest of all is that the machine tends to click itself off after a few minutes, around 5."
590,"Anyway I figured that my poor shots could be related to the amount of pressure, so I wind the steam wand valve shut before making another attempt, hoping that the added pressure might resolve it. Nope."
591,"Despite descaling, grinding as fine as possible (Sage Smart Grinder), nothing seems to work. And my shots always seem to be done in around 20 seconds."
592,"I go in with 20g of coffee (not cheap beans, mind; speciality grade from Square Mile Coffee or Manhattan)."
593,Really at the end of my tether. I've been making V60 filters and I get much better success. And I loved this Gaggia unit.
594,"I'm no expert, but I'm curious whether this is my own inability or if the machine has reached the end of the line, and if I should be looking at an upgrade. If there's anybody else who has ran into this kind of thing with a Gran Deluxe, would be great to hear how you solved that"
595,I'm 23 and never finished school or hardly had any work experience before this but I decided to knuckle down and work on my passion for coffee. I will be one of the new baristas at a local specialty cafe and I am both excited and anxious. There's still a lot that I have to learn (don't ask me to pour any latte art just yet).
596,"I live in Italy, so the dynamics of working behind the espresso machine in a specialty shop are a little interesting, being in a country that's very traditional when it comes to coffee, so you kind of have to learn how to make the specialty blends that come in taste more like an improved version of a classic Italian espresso. Overall I hope it will be a positive learning experience for me."
597,Do you have any advice for a new barista? I feel good about where I am but I'm also scared to get things wrong.
598,"Hi everyone,"
599,Just thought I’d spread a little word that I’ll be bringing the world of specialty coffee to 18 unsuspecting folks tomorrow morning.
600,"I’m a lecturer for a university (kinesiology) but I’ve never lectured on coffee. Although, coffee has been a massive, massive passion of mine since 2018."
601,"During my 3 hour seminar, I’ll be brewing 8 coffees for them using drip, French press, pour over, and even espresso. They’ll get a taste of coffees (I personally roasted) from across the equator and will include washed, natural, black honey, and one anaerobic. We’ll talk about growing, processing, roasting, brewing, etc. just about everything"
602,Im stoked to blow their minds with a taste of all that coffee can be! Wish me luck and thanks for reading!
603,Edit: spelling
604,"Edit 2: it went AMAZING…the only “downfall” is they were so into it that they had question after question throughout the entirety of it. So my projected 3 hour class took 6 hours!! But 16 of the 18 stayed for the entirety. They were very understanding this was the first run of this course. They got lots of giveaways, and also bought more coffee at the end. I think they really got a lot out of it. I was exhausted afterwards lol."
605,A lot of folks here asked for recordings and I’m sorry I just couldn’t make it happen. I will consider this in the future! I arrived two hours early to set up and had the help of my parents and gf and we still nearly started late!
606,However! I can anonymize the slides and post a link here for you all to view! I will do this soon! Thanks for all the support!
607,Edit 3: Link to Slides
608,"Maybe this is just me, but my first sip of coffee in the morning tastes a little off, bitter or stronger, but the second one onwards tastes better."
609,"I use an app to rate the brews I make, and if I use the first sip as reference I would rate it way lower than the second sip."
610,Any idea why?
611,I want to try the freeze distilled milk used in barista championships but I wonder if there is a faster process to do it at home.
612,"For those unfamiliar: freeze distilling milk starts with freezing milk completely than melting it inside your fridge till half the volume is liquid again. The whole process takes around 30 hours, removes a lot of the water content and leaves you with a doubly concentrated milk."
613,Why not cut the process to 25% of the time by simply only freezing half the volume then separating the liquid? The water freezes first then the proteins and fat last so theoretically it should work. Right?
614,"I'm living abroad for a few months, and all I have here is a cheap automatic drip machine - I have a nicer one at home, but I can't stand pourovers/etc and so I'm using this for now. It actually makes decent coffee out of what I usually buy, which is slightly cheaper medium-dark roasts. However, this time I bought a bag of lightly roasted Ethiopian beans, and it tastes... awful. Just really bland and watery."
615,"A quick google says that light roasts often need hotter water and finer grind (neither of which I can achieve). Actually, I think the beans might be an issue too - they were harder to grind than any coffee I've gotten before, such that I had to stop partway through because my motor grinder was getting too hot."
616,"Is there anything else I can change (just higher coffee concentration maybe?) with the limited equipment I have, or just accept that it won't taste too good?"
617,"I use a manual grinder (Kinu m47) for espresso. It's nice and reliable, grind size is easy to replicate, and overall it's a nice grinder."
618,Now here is the weird thing: it seems like grind size changes if I grind more coffee. I grind either 16g or 32g for one or two cups. My workflow is:
619,1cup: weigh 16g beans -> grind -> weigh 16g grounds -> brew
620,2 cups: weigh 32g beans -> grind all -> weigh 16g grounds + brew (x2)
621,"Thing is: when I make two cups, both flow much slower compared to when I only make one (like 5-7 seconds slower). I can't figure out why, is there another variable that I am missing, or is the quantity of beans affecting grind size?"
622,"I recently bought a 2lb bag of Costa Rica Las Lajas Natural from Onyx. However, I’m having significant trouble dialing this in on my plastic V60. I’ll tell you what I’m doing, and maybe you guys can help me dial in this coffee correctly."
623,"Currently, I’m using Hoffman’s new one-cup V60 method which is 15g/250g @ 205° water (I’m using 02 Hario tabbed filters). Currently, my Fellow Ode is set to one notch above 2. In the past, I’ve ground this coffee all the way from 2 notches above 1 all the way to 2 notches above 3. In other words, I’ve gone from essentially medium-fine/fine to medium-coarse. In all of my cups, especially on the finer grind sizes, the coffee seems very muddled, and on the coarser grind sizes, the coffee seems very sour. This coffee drains extremely quickly, btw."
624,"What do you think I could do? Should I increase my dose to 20g? Should I do something else? I’ve reached out to Onyx, but they aren’t any help."
625,Update: Would using a flat bottom Kalita Wave be better for this coffee than a conical V60? Onyx suggests so.
626,"Hello, I have just purchased a moccamaster select because I’m lazy and pouring water over ground coffee is too much like hard work in the morning."
627,One of the primary reasons I bought this thing was because it has a hot plate but EU regs state for the device past 2015 mean it turns off after 40 minutes.
628,"This is not ideal, I wanted the machine to brew me a big batch of coffee and keep it warm for at least 2 hours."
629,"I know, just make another batch bro! But the moccamaster shines when it’s at full capacity and I don’t want to drink “20 cups” of coffee (6 mugs)."
630,Can it be modified to bypass the auto off? Most posts about modifying the hot plate consist of cutting the wires to disable it - which is the complete opposite of what I want to achieve.
631,I want 2 hour old stale coffee dammit.
632,"(Real reason I got this and want the time extended, I’m expecting a child and just wanted to make brewing coffee easier and keep it hot while doing other things)"

639,Help with Water for light roast pour overs
640,This Week in Coffee; 31st of Jan '23
641,"So I recently got a rather special treat (and adequately priced) which was Nomad Coffee's Costa Rica (Centroamericano) which was put through the ""molasses"" processing. Initially I couldn't find much in the internet regarding this processing method and most of the results referred to decaf coffee. Have you ever tried such coffee? I found it rather difficult to get a balanced cup from it. It was very interesting but could easily become harsh in taste."
642,I'd love to learn more about the process and if there are any other rosters selling molasses coffee.
643,"I see this talked about in forums but never in any of the videos I've seen for V-60 techniques and I'm curious about the general consensus on the matter. Generally, I'll wait about ~5 seconds after the bed has settled (grounds are clearly visible and won't move from any agitation or swirling) because I've seen it mentioned many times that the tail end of a brew will mostly be bitter and over-extracted by that point but if I recall correctly, James Hoffman doesn't really give much attention to it in his videos and kind of glosses over it."
644,What is your method? Do you leave the cone on until it has stopped dripping? Remove it as soon as the grounds are visible? Or something in-between?
645,I've recently become interested in trying cupping for the first time to compare my new own-roasted coffee to pre-roasted specialty and supermarket coffee. The thing is I usually make espresso so I only have a Baratza Sette 30 grinder.
646,Will it grind course enough for cupping on its coursest setting or do I need to get something like a hario skerton to do it properly?
647,Edit: It seems the sette will do fine. Based on your responses I will stay as far away from the skerton as I can.
648,"Whenever I watched some grinder review on YouTube I wondered, whether normal people like me would taste a difference. Now I got the chance to try it for myself, I bought a Mignon Single Dose when it came out and recently my brother bought a Niche Zero and let me compare them for a while :-)"
649,"The answer is yes, we tasted quite a difference. We tried three espressos brewed with a Profitec Pro 300: a lightly roasted, funky, heavily fermented coffee from Columbia, a lightly roasted, spicy, natural coffee from Ethopia, and a dark roast, natural coffee from Brazil. With all three coffees the roasty, nutty, chocolaty notes were stronger with the Niche. With the light roasts, the spicy and fruity notes were clearer with the Mignon and we preferred that, but depending on your taste you might prefer the less acidic Niche espresso over the added complexity, particularly with the funky one. For the dark roast, however, we felt one day we tasted more flavors with the Mignon and the other with the Niche, so no conclusive answer there, beyond the roasty flavors."
650,"Regarding the handling, the only big difference I noticed was the seasoning of the burrs: With the Mignon it took quite a few bags of coffee, until we got reproducible espresso without channeling. Channeling was never an issue with the Niche, but the first bag of coffee had a harsh bitterness, that I remembered from new Commandantes. Otherwise it's potato potato, both are easy to dial in and use in general. With the Mignon you have to be a bit careful to not knock off the rubbery thing and with the Niche to not throw the coffee beans everywhere."
651,"I am fine with both designs, the Niche might be a bit smaller and quieter. The Mignon has these weird holes in the front, because they just mounted the standard case at an angle, and the Niche has this irritating LED, showing you when it's plugged in 🤷"
652,"TLDR; Even normies taste a difference; if you like ashtray coffee go for the Niche, if you like sour hounds go for the Mignon :-)"
653,So my current setup doesn’t include a Coffee Grinder and I’ve tried 3 different beans from local coffee shops and all taste just bitter. I intentionally under extracted a cup to see and it was still bitter.
654,"My current equipment is Aeropress, a set of coarse pre ground beans that I bought with french press initially and then I bought Pour Over Grind Colombia Los Cauchos beans with my aeropresso."
655,I’m not sure if freshly roasted pre ground beans just taste bad and I 100% need a grinder?
656,Thanks for all of your help :)
657,"I'd like to try alternatives to Third Wave Water for pour overs with light roast coffees, and can use advice on the best place to begin without getting overly lost into exponentially more variables (seems to be the trend with a coffee hobby😊)"
658,"I'm hoping to try alternatives because I found that when I get light roasts from roasters such as La Cabra, Manhattan, Sey, April, etc, my water seems to be much harder than what they suggest and I have trouble capturing the most out of their coffees. I've heard experts (like Scott Rao) claim TWW is not their favorite, so I'd love to find new approaches and see what I could be missing out on."
659,A.) Should I begin with Barista Hustle's guide?
660,"If so, my concern is that they only use two ingredients (Epsom salt and baking soda), and I'm worried I'll be missing key ingredients I've heard others discuss (potassium, calcium)"
661,"also if so, anyone have a suggestion for which recipe is a good starting point for helping with clarity/sweetness/vibrancy of light roasts?"
662,"B.) OR, should I try Lotus Coffee Water drops?"
663,"My main concerns here are whether it's very expensive (hard for me to judge) and if it will lead me to too many variables? Though, it does seem like a very simple set of variables with the droplet approach."
664,Any guidance at all would be extremely helpful! Thanks so much
665,I'm in London this week but taking time to tour the great coffee establishments here and purchase more coffee than I can feasibly ever drink.

I currently have my eyes on buying some from Manhattan Coffee Roasters but I am looking to only buy one for now since two at once would be overkill for my wallet but I can't decide which one I should purchase for my first gesha. I am in between getting one that's a ""double fermentation thermal shock process"" or an ""anaerobic natural."" I got the idea of snagging the double fermentation one after watching a video where a guy was just completely gushing over the beans with how sweet and wild the experience was to drink, but I am curious are the flavors wild ONLY because of the heavy fermentation behind it or with it being a geisha also contributes to the flavor. Really curious to know what you guys think and will appreciate any help in making my decision! Thanks for your time :)"
702,EDIT: Just want to give a huge thanks for all of the discussion you guys contributed to my post. Really enjoyed reading and learning some new things about experimental processing and I’m definitely going to listen to the podcast by Lucia Solis.
703,"My very first experience with specialty freshly roasted beans was an Ethiopian yirgacheffe coffee from a local roaster. And it was absolutely amazing. Even with my shitty setup (hario skerton and v60 with a standard kettle), I got some incredible floral fruity results. It was almost like elderflower tea, but coffee."
704,"So obviously I bought a bunch of Ethiopian beans back then, and loved them all."
705,"But I find that now, 5 ish years later, Ethiopian beans are much more boring, mellow, closer to stone fruits in taste, and just not the same. And this is the exact same beans from the same roasters than what I used back in the days."
706,"So, what happened? Has Ethiopian coffee fallen off its throne, or has multiple local roasters forgotten how to roast correctly?"
707,"What should I try to get that very light, bright, elderflower tasting/smelling beans again?"
708,"I am new to this.  Just got set up with a Gaggia Classic, Eureka Mignon Sinlenzio and all the other bits I need."
709,Ready to get the machine up and going today but I want to select the proper beans for me.
710,I have been doing a lot of research and understand that freshly roasted beans are important.
711,So I have gone out to a few coffee shops that use freshly roasted beans.  Indeed the one in my town roasts in a building next to their café.  They sell these beans online and in the shop.
712,"However, after ordering an array of espresso drinks there including a double espresso, macchiato, cappuccino and an americano just to get some tastes of the coffee, I don't like it at all."
713,"What I don't know is if I am just way to new to this to understand what good is or their barista's aren't very good with the machines?  Like, could this be good coffee and I just don't get it?  To me their coffee attacked the hell out of my tongue and the taste lingered for hours."
714,Or could this just be the roast being bad?
715,I ask because this could be a great way for me to get freshly roasted coffee on the regular and if it is just the barista's not being great I can safely get some beans there.
716,"The worst part is, and I know this will get me a lot of flack, but the worst part is so far of all the espresso I have tasted I like the Starbucks the best.  It has this dark sweet flavor to me that goes oh so well with some properly frothed milk."
717,Do you guys think I should just try some of their freshly roasted beans and go for it?  Or maybe find something else online?  Because at this point I am inclined to buy some Whole bean starbucks espresso roast and just see where that gets me and forgo all of the knowledge telling me that fresh roasted and roast dates are important.
718,"It isn't like I have no experience with coffee, it is just that my main experience with Espresso is via Starbucks and through foods and such."
719,"I do know that it is possible that I just haven't developed a taste for true fresh roasted espresso.  For instance, when I started smoking cigars, they just tasted all the same to me, and left me feeling like my mouth was an ashtray, but over the course of a couple months or so I was able to tell what I was smoking and could tell the differences in them and that first cigar I smoked ended up tasting phenomenal once my tastes had developed.  Could that be the case here?  Or could it just be bad coffee."
720,"I could use some advice, and would appreciate it a lot."
721,Thanks in advance.
722,"Let me start off by saying that I am a huge enjoyer of good coffee but I'm not an expert in this, so bear with me."
723,"Yesterday I went to a shop that sells all sorts of interesting nuts, teas, spices, powders and similar stuff by weight. A jar of roasted coffee beans caught my eye because it was selling like crazy, judging from the amount left - it said ""vanilla and orange""."
724,"Now, I tried lightly roasted beans and I know how fruity and acidic instead of bitter can such coffee taste, I knew that you can get some pretty interesting flavor notes from coffee beans."
725,"However, these beans looked darker than lightly roasted ones and they smelled like straight-up sweet oranges, the flavor you'd find in jaffa cakes. I was intrigued so I bought some (expensive af). I asked the guy who works there if this is somehow infused or do beans themselves naturally have that flavor - he said they just have that flavor."
726,"This morning, I brewed me some (percolation method, don't judge me, I like it like that :P) and OH MY GOD... I'm just bewildered, confused and in awe... feels like I tasted something forbidden, arcane and incomprehensible to the human mind."
727,"It tastes NOTHING like the basic ""coffee flavor"" most people are used to, it's almost sublime, no bitterness, a slight tinge of acidity and an unmistakeable delicious taste of oranges. It didn't taste like coffee with orange flavor added, it was its own thing, a complex flavor experience with a story from the moment the first notes hit you to the aftertaste you're left with."
728,"I never tasted a better drink in my life, no exaggeration."
729,So my question is - is it really possible to achieve such flavors through careful cultivation and roasting without introducing actual oranges at any point?
730,"I got a Fellow brand canister for my beans and am frustrated that the airlock frequently does not work.  I twist it closed vigorously, back and forth probably 20 times and it seems to seal but the next morning the lid just comes off without needing to release the airlock.  Anyone else experience this?  Is there a better product out there?"

743,"We've both made some career advancements since getting it, so we're open to spending a little more on modifications if it's worth the price, but we're unsure of where to start. Any guidance from anyone is very greatly appreciated. Thanks!"
744,"Hi everyone, my mother - a chef who knows little about coffee except how to operate a Nespresso - is setting up a small village cafe and shop in the very small English village she lives in. The village recently lost its pub, so it's in need of somewhere for people to socialise, and it has potential for tourism. We hope to be able to bring a bit more social space and togetherness to the village."
745,"Part of the discussion has been about espresso and milk drinks, and I'm wondering what advice people here would have for a (very) small cafe setup in a cafe that won't have too many customers. The budget is limited, but I'm chipping in to help, and our rent will be very low due to the village hall helping."
746,"It won't be intensive, the village only has 400 people, though might need to do several drinks in a row at peak times for when friends visit together and the after church rush hour. That said, I can't imagine my mother managing more than one drink at a time. I will be going down to the village to teach her how to operate everything, but my only experience is with basic home setups, and I'm also looking for barista courses in her county (Devon)."
747,Do you have any recommendations for grinders? Machines? We want the coffee to actually be decent - if the shop doesn't work I will use it in the future - but i'd say speed and a crazy efficient workflow aren't the greatest concerns.
748,"I guess the budget is somewhere around £1500, but can be extended for a really good reason."
749,Grinder: Niche Zero? DF64? Malkohnig x54?
750,"Machine: No idea! But around the £1000 mark is probably our limit. Needs water tank options, as we can't do plumbing there. Someone in another thread recommended Rancillo Silvia."
751,"Second hand: We'd be happy to go the second hand route, but have no idea how to find second hand equipment in the UK."
752,"In my years of life, I never had a favorite shop to close its doors. Okay, maybe one or two. However, in just the past month I've witnessed two excellent speciality coffeeshops close their doors here in Manchester."
753,"This city is already lacking in terms of a third wave scene. I only know of a handful speciality coffeeshops (my 300k city in Saudi Arabia has ~60-70). Only ones going strong in Manchester are the ones with a kitchen and/or a bakery. These types of coffeeshops can absolutely make good coffee, but unfortunately I think doing so much has to stretch you thin."
754,"I love going out daily to drink coffee, spend time at coffeeshops and study and meet friends and do everything in between. I love conversing with baristas and roasters, and they are usually interested in conversing back. It's just a part of my day that makes me very happy, but the model of a coffeeshop having a kitchen/bakery just changes the atomosphere and people's interest in talking about coffee completely."
755,No one is to blame. They're businesses and they need to make money. It's just a truth of life that I really hate.
756,This is my 2nd experiment making Anaerobic coffees.
757,Coffee Origin: Vietnam
758,"Variables for Fermenting: Cascara, wine yeast, bread yeast, natural fermentation(lacto)"
759,"Each coffee that was fermented weighted in total about 2.5lbs each. Each had two cups of Brazilian cascara added to it, and covered entirely with water. I left the beans to hydrate for 4 hours, added more water as it soaked up. Once the beans were hydrated I introduced yeasts into two of them. One with a bread yeast, another with a wine yeast. The last container I did not add anything and let a lacto fermentation occur naturally."
760,"Each of these were fermented for 7 days, with water added halfway through. After 7 days, they were then rinsed and laid out on trays to dry out. After 6 days, they were fully dried out, I cleaned out the cascara and they were ready to roast."
761,"All were roasted to a medium roast, and were rested for a day before brewing. I brewed using a v60, 10 grams of coffee and 150 grams of water."
762,"Flavor wise there was not a significant difference, with the exception of the natural/lacto fermentation"
763,"Control: Mellow, floral, with some acidity Bread Yeast: Very similar, but less acidity and more mellow Wine Yeast: Even less acidity, and more floral Natural/Lacto: Super floral(almost tastes like dill), least acidity"
764,"Overall I think the yeasts didn’t provide the Anaerobic fermentation flavors I enjoyed so much in my first experiment, but the natural fermentation did. They didn’t really change the flavor of the coffee, but at least they did produce a less acidic and smoother cup."
765,I think my next experiment I will attempt using Koji culture I have for making sake. Any other cultures or fermentation recommendations would be welcomed.
766,"I loved it, the pepper gave the coffee (an otherwise underwhelming roast) an earthy abrasiveness to it. You couldn’t really tell it was pepper. It completely changed how I enjoyed that cup."
767,"Try it out, eager to hear what everyone else thinks"
768,I’m using 20g of coffee with a double bloom and two pour method. With a ratio of 1:15 should my total weight be 300g including the weight of the wet coffee in the filter and not the actual ml in the cup? Or does the ratio translate into 300ml of coffee?
769,Hope this makes sense.
770,Is it possible to use the AeroPress reusable filter that's made of stainless steel with a Bialetti moka pot?Has anyone here tried it?I love my paper filters but using so many of them feels like such a waste.
771,"Hi, I've noticed that my manual grinder coarsens grind size during grinding and I'm unsure why. It's a grinder from AliExpress and it's basically a timemore C3 inside and out. Recently it started to click down during grinding of any beans and almost any grind size. Would anyone have an idea as to what might be causing this, maybe a weakened spring or is it something else?"
772,I've come full circle really. I started off my fresh (ish) coffee journey about 15 years ago using a French press with pre-ground coffee. I bought an espresso machine (Gaggia Baby) and a grinder and started making espresso. French Press became my inferior alternative when either my machine was broken (which is was often) or I was away from home. FP always tasted muddy and muddled and bitter. Didn't really reveal much about the bean.
773,"In the past couple of years I've gone through an intense espresso journey. I've really started to pay attention to my technique and my beans, and I've made leaps and bounds. I've realised a lever machine is the one for me, and in the past year or so I've made some of the best espressos I've ever tasted."
774,"I then fell in love with pourover and really started concentrating even harder on the beans. Working out what I liked and seeking out local roasteries I can converse with and buy and sample coffees in their prime. I realised that espresso is indeed not the be-all and end-all, and to me actually much more enjoyment can be got from a carefully prepared pourover."
775,"Then I started reading about the ""immersion is better than percolation"" stuff and read James Hoffman's FP method. I found a single-cup (10oz) FP at work, a metal one with thermal walls. I tried the method, and by jove it's even better than pourover. Most mornings now I will make a French Press first thing in the morning, then attempt to better it mid-morning with my Hario V60, and every time I prefer the French Press."
776,"I find with the French Press it's simply an intrinsically more reliable and less error-prone method. The coffee is always, always extracted with intensity, body and the right level of acidity for the particular roast, and next to zero bitterness. This eben applies to less-than-perfect beans, i.e. ones off the supermarket shelves."
777,"And don't get me wrong, it can be bad. At work someone will regularly make a huge jug of french press, evidently all wrong. It's bitter above anything else and at the same time lacking any kind of richness or subtlety. So I guess it all comes down to technique, I've gone from using the wrong technique, and thinking French Press was possibly my least favourite method, to finding the right technique and reaching the conclusion that I don't think I can better it as a method of extraction."
778,"I want to learn how to pour more consistently so that my brew will be better, since now I’m having problems with maintaining a slow flow rate even with my gooseneck. Is there any way to practice this without wasting a lot of coffee?"
779,"I'm getting more and more into washed or fermented blends and finding they have different requirements- or rather my preferences are different. I normally switch between French press, Moka pot and Aeropress. I'm finding with these more flavorful beans the French press isn't really to my liking. I'd say of the three, the Aeropress deals with them the best."
780,I don't have a way to make espresso at home but beginning to consider a hot water/ handpress-type because the place where I buy my favorite varieties use a fermented blend to pull shots and it is heavenly.
781,Any other thoughts about preparing these beans?

786,Chemex-like filters for automatic machines
787,"Title mainly. I know when pouring over ice, you go use half the water and replace the other half with ice but would that also not lead to half the extraction?"
788,"I just made did that and to try and compensate for what i assume is worse extraction, i ground my beans finer than normal and it doesn't taste bad but not nearly the same as it normally does, more acidic and almost none of that natural sweetness"
789,"Texturally it's good, not watered down at all which I'm glad about but the taste leads me to think ive underextracted."
790,Curious if theres a proper way to do this or if i need to just experiment with different ice:water ratios
791,"Had my Tricolate for over a week and in that time have had nothing but mediocre coffee out of it trying to use any high-extraction recipes where the ratios are 1:20 - 1:22. Part of the point of buying it for me was to use less coffee when I have something nicer on my hands, and I understand using ratios like that will obviously give lighter body, but  every cup I brew is either mediocre water or just bad water. I could get a brew time of 5 minutes that tastes like lemon water, or perhaps a brew time of over 10 minutes that tastes like woody water. I’ve tried their suggested high-extraction recipe at various grinds/brew times as well has Lance Hedrick’s method with various grinds/brew time."
792,"I understand I can use traditional ratios and just have the zero-bypass brewer on my hands minus the efficiency, but I am having trouble seeing how people hype this as their daily brewer using these 1:20+ ratios. This is also coming from a person who likes delicate tea-like nordic roasts on Chemex etc. Am I missing something?"
793,"I heard and investigated a little bit about the origins of American coffee and I found that it comes from American soldiers that during WWII used to be served and expresso with a glass o hot water in Italy, can anyone confirm that?"
794,"I have heard Lance Hedrick mention that chaff either weakens a coffee’s flavor or it imparts a paper taste to it at worst. Sprometheus stated that it doesn’t unless the coffee dose is low. However, he did not account for bean variety, processing technique, or roast level as far as I could recall."
795,"I tried removing chaff and noticed a more pronounced flavor profile on a washed coffee. On the other hand, I never did that for coffee processed any other way, including anaerobic washed. I also started removing chaff at the same time that I started removing quakers and other bad beans from my coffee."
796,"In addition, I am curious as to what the effect, or lack thereof, would be for coffees with big, loud flavors like boozy anaerobic naturals, and how big a difference it would make for coffees more than 3 weeks after the roasting date."
797,"So, does chaff affect coffee flavor? Do bad beans affect it more? Does either make a bigger difference for coffees with more subtle flavors like washed coffees?"
798,"Does anyone know if there is a filter like Chemex that’s the size of a Kalita 185 filter or a standard flat bottom filter? I really like the clean taste of Chemex, but want to use my automatic Oxo 8 Cup brewer."

815,"Hey folks, hope everyone’s week is going well with lots of great coffee!"
816,"I’m in a dilemma. I have a dream of opening a cafe myself one day but currently work in tech full time. It’s a dream of mine bc I love cafes, making coffee for people, and generally crave owning something of my own. I’d want my cafe to rly focus on coffee quality rather than just being a business."
817,"I can’t switch careers fully right now due to financial constraints. I part timed on the weekend for a bit but took a break when I moved. I thought I’d really want to part time again, and I kind of do, but I’m also unsure about the longevity of working 7 days a week (full time tech job on weekdays and part time barista job on weekends)."
818,"I’m hoping to get some opinions. I’m unsure about committing to part time during the weekend because 1) I can burn out and end up doing poorly in both jobs, 2) I felt like I wasn’t learning as much as I could on the weekends since I don’t benefit from the repetition of learning during the week, and 3) this might be a lazy reason, but I do want to travel more this year so doing part time on the weekends is a blocker."
819,I’d like opinions from y’all. Is part time at a cafe my only option? Are there other things I can maybe focus on with more flexible times? I’m in my late 20s right now and worry if I limit my options if I don’t get good enough by a certain age.
820,Open to any ideas and thoughts. TIA!
821,I brew beer. A huge consideration for getting a perfect pint is water chemistry. How many parts per million(ppm) of sulfate? Ppm of calcium chloride? Etc.
822,Is water chemistry a consideration when making the perfect cup? I know alot of cafes us RO water.
823,I suspect a thick and soft mouth feel would make for an interesting cup. I know how to get that manipulating chalk and sulfates in beer. Can you do it with coffee?
824,I have a bag of Lighthouse espresso roast that is coming out really astringent despite making the grind coarser. I feel like there's a variable I'm missing here and I'm looking for ideas.
825,"Typically I do an Aeropress prep using the recipe that comes in the box (1 scoop/~15g, 80C, water to (1) line, stir 10x, press), using JX Pro grinder at 30-32 (3 turns from full stop + 0 to 2 by the numbers). This works great for other bags such as Olympia Big Truck, Olympia Morning Sun, Onyx Power Nap, and Stumptown Holler Mountain. I also use my Cafelat Robot and Chemex from time to time - these come out well, too."
826,"With this bag, it's just so far off from the other stuff I brew I'm not sure where to begin. If I make it too coarse, the coffee gets weak without improving. I had a similar experience with Just Coffee Skate Perk a month ago - just couldn't make it work in Aeropress or Chemex. One thing I did notice about these two bags - the beans were significantly easier to grind than the others."
827,Ever tried soup (or most any dish) without salt and oil?
828,Tasteless. Terrible.
829,Why doesn’t coffee need it?
830,"More so, why isn’t salt or oil improving the taste?"
831,"How would i clean the water level tube on an perlocleator, I found an old perlocleator that I could get mostly clean but clean the tube the person the use regularly only rinsed it out poorly after each use and there is a lot of build up in the tube."

833,"I'm a newbie to the homebrewing world, and I've started off with launching myself into v60 pour over."
834,"I recently purchased a bag of washed Ethiopian light roast beans. All my brews I have made have had the most fantastic aroma - bergamot/concord grape/lemon, yet the flavor has been severely underwhelming."
835,"Each brew I've been changing a variable at a time to no avail. It was suggested to me to try a cupping with the beans to find their flavor profile - and that's what I did. Again, the taste was quite lacking, some notable 'coffee' flavor and hints of black tea, but nothing I would describe as great or delicious."
836,"For note, I am not trying to capture the aromas as taste, but more-so bring out some defined, perhaps interesting flavors."
837,"Now rather than trying to dial in this bean, is the cupping a true reflection of how the bean will taste when brewed correctly? Am I aiming for something that isn't there?"
838,"Can I keep the ratio same say 55grams to 1 litre and brew a very small batch say 5 grams of coffee and 100ml water to master my technique, grind size etc? And brew multiple batches to test it out?"
839,"If I keep the ratio the same, does it even really matter if I brew 11 grams of coffee of 1 gram?"
840,I'm trying to find the fastest way to experiment with different variables without wasting much. This is something that I didn't see being discussed in any YouTube video I've watched so far.
841,I'm trying to taste what underextracted is and what overextracted tastes like etc to start building a profile for tasting coffee and understanding my errors in a better way.
842,I'm struggling to get the foam to be heavy enough maybe? Not sure how to get foam that makes the top white but also can push other stuff out of the way if that makes sense 
843,Since purchasing a Fellow Ode I’ve had issues with static causing fines to cling to the underside of the grinder and make a mess.
844,"I’ve tried sprinkling in water and it helps but still noticed that when I touched the catch|cup after grinding, I could perceive a static shock."
845,It got me thinking: “if my body can be a big enough sink for the charge imbalance in this thing to want to balance out with me and it can conduct well enough that it happens by just touching it after… what if I touch it during operation to behave as a ground?”
846,Experiment conclusion: it works for me.
847,Edit: note that this finding applies to a first generation Fellow Ode. The second generation (currently on sale?) has an anti-static buildup feature that reportedly works well.
848,TL;DR first generation Fellow Ode works better when you hold its hand while grinding.
849,"Hi, I’m new here and read the rules but in case I missed anything I apologise in advance :)"
850,"When I buy specialty coffee, I don’t often buy from roasters who specify espresso or filter on the packs, however on the few occasions I have the roasters have been correct (surprise surprise)"
851,"I don’t have an espresso machine at home, but find most espresso blends work well in a moka. I also use a v60 (do I need to say filter blends work well in that?), and acquired an aeropress last weekend and have been taking it into work."
852,"The recipe I’m using I would say gives me a result that’s a middle ground between a filter coffee and a moka brew, and I’m enjoying the results thus far."
853,I’ve also been buying more from Square Mile and Friedhats which tend to specify espresso or filter on the packs.
854,So two questions:
855,how do roasters differentiate between espresso and filter blends (more so I know what to look out for from roasters who don’t)
856,would you lean more towards espresso roast or filter roast given the result I’ve been getting from the aeropress?

858,"*as a side note, I have a preference for berry flavours that are on the more savoury side, but like exploring all flavours in the light roast realm"

860,"By doing this, it should have maximum agitation - but should I be doing this throughout my whole brew? I do 45g by 5 pours. Should I minimise agitation on the last half of the brew on pours 4 and 5 by lowering my pour height slightly (but keeping pour rate the same)"
861,I seem to be getting an issue with my beans going stale very quickly. I lived in different countries and bought from many different roasters and when I open the bag it smells so fresh and with all the flavours. Give it a few days or maybe a week and the beans smell like they have gone bad. I always keep them in the original bag and am so careful to seal it 100%. I have also tried those glass tupperware containers but I think its the same issue.  The proof is in the brews as there is basically no flavour anymore. Any tips?
862,"I’m curious as to how people’s tastes and preferences have changed with regards to beans, flavour characteristics, etc. after starting their coffee journey."

890,"When frothing my oat milk, it seems to froth up heavily before it gets warm. My resulting cappuccinos/lattes are practically room temperature, maybe even lower."
891,"I'm using a SMEG, with one of those metal cylindrical frothers on the side. Yes, I know, but it was a present from my mum before I got really into it so am giving it the best chance I can."
892,The temperature was fine in my old pitcher but I've recently downsized to a 12oz and only froth 150ml at a time to reduce waste.
893,The technique I use is to dip the wand in ever so slightly and tilt the pitcher sideways to get the whirlpool before dropping it down further after I have the consistency I'm aiming for.
894,"Does anyone know why this could be happening? I have a feeling it's the wand and I'm looking to purchase a proper one to mod the machine, but want to make sure that's the case before doing so. Might even consider another machine if that's the only fix because I'm getting really serious about it now, but like I mentioned above, want to give my current one the best chance of success."
895,"To brew my daily pourover, I've been using water from a Zojurushi water boiler, and dispensing it into a kettle to pour onto the grounds."
896,"The water boiler is set to 208 degrees F, but I was surprised to learn via a pocket thermometer that the temperature drops to ~180 F by the time it hits the kettle. To get the water to a preferred temperature, I re-boil the water over a gas stove."
897,"Short of getting an electric kettle, any suggestions for preserving the temperature? I'm surprised that the act of dispensing it makes it drop so quickly."
898,"All the V60 brews I make are decent, but not good, and I don’t know why. I  have a Comandante C40 and use 30 clicks for the 4:6 method. I’ve played around with 28, 29 and 31 and 32 clicks but found 30 to be the most suitable for the beans I’m using( Colombian Gesha). I also use Aquacode for my water which did result in some improvements. The cup I make is just very weak tasting, with only faint notes of jasmine and apple. The acidity is also quite high. I use 15 grams of ground coffee to 225 g. Could it be my pouring? I use a Hario Buono kettle and usually a 45g pour is over in under 4 seconds. Should I be pouring slower?"
899,"Hey all, so I’ve been trying my darnedest to get proficient with the V60 since I got it for Xmas, with some decent results. I’ve been brewing 2-3 cups a day with it exclusively and for the most part really love it. The whole process is just fun to me- the equipment, the bloom, the aromas, the pours, and obviously drinking the coffee. Sometimes I wake up a bit early and can’t fall back sleep cause I’m too excited to make coffee 😂"
900,"I started with the standard (older) Hoffmann method but quickly moved to his newer 1 cup 5 pour method once I got the hang of pouring consistently with my gooseneck kettle without sputtering the stream. I’d say I’m getting a great cup 1 out of every 3 tries or so even though I’m doing the exact same thing every time. I do pours as low over the v60 as possible, starting in the center and gradually circling out not quite to the edge and then back to the middle. Everything is the exact same, brew time is basically the same for each cup when using the same beans, but each cup tastes a bit different. None of them taste particularly bad- all are smooth and enjoyable, but 1 out of every 3 cups or so really sticks out as great where the tasting notes really pop."
901,"So it got me thinking- I live in Colorado where water boils at 202F, and my favorite coffees are the really fruity floral light roasts- especially natural processed or extended fermentation coffees, as well as Ethiopians. The general consensus seems to be to use as hot of water as possible for these types of coffees so I’m obviously at a bit of a disadvantage there. I try to really thoroughly preheat the mug and V60 by pouring a good bit of water through the V60 and filter into the mug, swirling till the whole mug is warm, and then pouring back through the V60 one more time."
902,"So from what I can think of and from what I’ve found online, I have a few different options to try to compensate for the lower brew temp:"
903,Grind finer for more extraction since the water is lower temp
904,Agitate as much as possible to maximize extraction
905,use slower filter papers to increase drawdown and extraction
906,use a different brewer such as the Kalita Wave or Hario switch for a slower drawdown and hopefully more consistent/ repeatable results (although the need to thoroughly preheat something like the Kalita could be a potential inconsistent variable that could negatively affect an already low brew temp)
907,"I would love to hear from anyone that has experience with light roast pour overs at elevation and what has worked best for them, or anyone’s thoughts on it in general. I’m using a heptagonal 1zpresso Q2 (with a ZP6 on the way), a temp controlled gooseneck, and a plastic v60 with cafec abaca filters."
908,"TL,DR- what’s the best way to brew light roast pour overs at elevation? 😂😬☺️"
909,Following my usual recipe (using 1:16) of 16gr of coffee for 250ml water giving me great consistent results.
910,"What happens in regards to pouring time when I want to double it for 2 cups?If I bloom for 45 seconds for one cup, how does it scale for 2?"
911,Lost in the math here...
912,"So I've started making as little coffee per filter as possible because literally thirty minutes after I make a pot, the coffee tastes bad. If I leave the hot plate on and there's not a lot of coffee in the carafe, it'll be burnt; if the hot plate is off, then the coffee just seems to lose all of its flavor."
913,"Now here's the confounding factor: I do have to put the coffee in the microwave to reheat it. If I do this to the coffee in my mug that I poured fresh, it will usually still taste decent unless either 1) I reheat it too long or too many times (twice seems to be the maximum) or 2) I let the coffee get ice cold and sit for maybe forty-five minutes."
914,"If I reheat a mug of coffee poured from a 30-minute to one-hour old pot, it will almost invariably taste flavorless and/or horrible."

917,I had a bag of passion fruit-macerated Colombia Caturra from Coffee Project in NYC and absolutely fell in love with it. But...it's also been the only bag (and specific fruit) I've tried. I wonder if it's consistently good as a process? The passion fruit flavor was very forward but it absolutely worked in this particular coffee. It's also not easy to find other coffees using a similar technique to compare it with.

926,"I know some water is going to get soaked up in the grounds, but losing that much water seems odd. Do y’all have any thoughts on what might be causing that? Is it time for a new machine? For reference, I just ran a descaling cycle yesterday. Thanks I. Advance for any help you can provide!"

948,"Whenever I pour from my Stagg Kettle, the water usually pours a nice, steady stream. However, on occasion the stream is somewhat interrupted with spurts, kinda like when you pour a liquid from a bottle. I hope that makes sense. Any idea what I'm doing wrong?"

950,"I've been making coffee for a while now. I buy a light roast from a local cafe, dial it in on my Baratza Encore which I clean monthly or whenever I try some new beans, use an electric kettle with temperature control (usually 200 F), brew in an Aeropress (13g grounds, 250g water, swirl 5-8 times, brew for 3 minutes, break crust, press), and let my coffee cool for a bit before drinking."
951,"I've varied my brew time, grind size, water temperature, press speed, coffee ratios, used multiple filters, added ice to cool it down, and nothing I do makes my coffee taste really great. It's fine, honest. It's not excessively bitter or sour, not overly astringent, nothing obviously wrong with it. It's just not particularly amazing. I thought maybe it was the coffee, so I tried a washed, single-origin Ethiopian bean and I got similar results. Recently I went to the bay area and picked up a bag of Solano Roast from Souvenir Coffee Company (they make really good coffee for anybody near Berkeley or Albany and staff some really knowledgeable people). When I had it in the shop, it was a wonderful combination of floral and fruity notes with a nutty undertone. I often perceive flavors as colors, and it came out as splashes of lavender and pink over a substrate of a gentle transparent brown. To this day, it is the best coffee I have ever had. I took a bag home, and none of that was there no matter what I tried. In fact, every coffee I try at home tastes kind of the same: some fruity or acidic notes with this sort of generic chocolaty taste. It's just kind of whatever. Not great. Not terrible. Just kind of... okay I guess."
952,"I know the Encore isn't the best, but surely it can at least make a good cup of Aeropress coffee? I've got clean filtered water that I get out of an under-sink filtration system, weigh out all my ingredients to within a few percentage points of my target, and always keep time. What am I doing wrong?"
953,"I love the 'What have you been brewing this week' posts on the subreddit, so I decided to do some analysis of the posts. At the end, I'll post a link to the google sheet so you can see the raw data as well."

955,My local coffee shop has a zero bypass brewer and I'd been liking the way their pour overs turn out with it. I thought about ordering one but figured I'd just test  zero bypass with my AeroPress  and it actually works quite well.
956,The Recipe I've been using is fairly basic:
957,Load 2 filters and rinse the filters/chamber.
958,"18 grams light roast, typical pour over grind."
959,350g of boiling water. It won't quite fit it all in one pour but if you bloom 50g around 45 seconds it should all go right up to the lip.
960,Draw down takes around 4 minutes. When it stops dripping you can insert the plunger and push down an inch or so to push the remaining water out of the cake.
961,I'm surprised how well it works. I have the same beans the coffee shop uses and there's virtually no difference between the AeroPress and their zero bypass brewer.
962,I haven't tried a single filter brew yet but I imagine the draw down will be to quick and produce a weaker cup.
963,"Excuse the long-winded approach to my question but I'd like to give you some back story. So I attended an introductory coffee course, I was very well impressed. We discussed coffee sources, different tree varieties, fermentation processes, drying, and roasting. It ended with a coffee cupping session to help identify specialty coffee vs commercial store-bought coffee. The course was delivered by an SCA accredited person. They knew what they were doing."
964,"I was oogling all the awesome coffee gadgetry - Rocket Espresso Cronometro R, Mahlkönig EK-43S, Kalifa, Fellow, Hario and Timemore."
965,So naturally I popped the question where do I start? right now with budgetary and location constraints I can only have a pour-over kit and was looking at getting a Timemore Chestnut ESP Hand Grinder to start with. I feel it is a rite of passage that can lead into a lovely yet expensive rabbit hole of a hobby
966,The person said not to waste my money on a 150Eur hand grinder as it'll be rendered useless further down the line when I can increase my budget and switch to a better electric grinder.
967,Anywho just wanted to see if you faithful coffee enthusiasts agree with that logic.
968,"I was doing an experiment for my biology lesson to determine how fat content will affect the foaming of milk. All scientific papers claim that skim milk is the best for frothing. However, my results showed the opposite. Though with other samples (1.5% and 3% of fat) the foam stability was decreasing with the increased fat content. All the conditions were the same, and milk had the same content of other things (proteins, sugars etc). I had 5 replications and skim milk didnt froth at all and now I dont know why. If someone has explanation for this I would really appreciate it :)"
969,"So I work at a larger 3rd-wave coffee company, and our beans use “service ranges” — corporate’s way of ensuring we wait until the beans adequately offgass before they go into service. However, my manager is not the best at ordering so we oftentimes end up having to use beans that aren’t in the “service range”, or offgassed enough to serve (at least according to company standard)."
970,"So the argument lays here: my store manager’s solution is to open the bags and let them sit open on the counter for hours before service in order to “speed up” the offgassing process. I strongly disagree with this practice and tell them I feel that the coffee already offgasses as fast as it can using the valve in the bag, at least without oxidizing. My stance is that it is probably better to serve coffee that is like 3 days off roast that was just opened, as opposed to coffee that is 3 days off roast but has also been exposed to oxygen which could have made it more stale tasting."
971,"Obviously the best solution is for them to get better at ordering in the first place, but who would you say is in the right here?"
972,"I always thought I made a great v60 with my regular kettle, but a gooseneck is a crazy improvement. I had to grind slightly more coarse as at first I was getting some over extracted flavours, but now it's like a whole new world of flavour. I can wholeheartedly recommend anyone who enjoys a pour over to grab one when they can. It's 100% worth it."

990,"Like many of us, I watched James Hoffmann's recent videos on brewing a 1-cup v60, including the Q&A in which he suggests preheatung ceramic v60s in the sink or upside down over your kettle as it heats. I'm definitely not comfortable setting my brewer in my kitchen sink, and my kettle isn't able to stably hold my v60 in the recommended upside down position. I wanted a better way to get the brewer properly preheated, so this morning I put it over the kettle right side up (as if I were brewing into the kettle), placed a small saucer that I rest the v60 on after brewing on top as a sort of makeshift lid to trap the steam. By the time my water was boiled and my coffee ground, the v60 was very well preheated, and I didn't have to boil and waste extra water to achieve this. Hope it helps if you, like me, have been struggling to find a way to preheat a ceramic v60 with a kettle that can't accommodate it upside down!"

1008,If I was to replace my Bahmor should I buy the new version or maybe try a Moccamaster ?
1009,"In a attempt to cut down on consumer waste I emailed Bahmor inquiring about a refreash or spa service for my Brazen. I could mail it in and the ""update"" the software, fix the lid and beeper. They said they dont offer anything like that."
1010,I guess option 3 would be to just keep using it until it doenst function anymore.
1011,"This has been bothering me a lot more than it should. Particularly as I'm fine tuning a couple of spreadsheets so I can quickly work out weights for pourover, Aeropress etc."
1012,"We obviously talk about ratios of coffee to water. Espresso may be 1:2 and pourover may be say 1:16. When we're talking about espresso, we're definitely talking about <weight of coffee grounds>:<weight of coffee out>. This makes sense as it's difficult for most people to tell how much water has gone in to an espresso. However when we're talking about pourover in all cases I've seen we're talking about <weight of coffee grounds>:<weight of water IN>. Hoffman's recipe for example (and I know it's not the only one, it's not the be-all and end-all) very specifically talks about measuring the total water in and working out the ratio based on that. However we know, and Hoffman himself regularly mentions, that the coffee out will be less than water in, by approximately twice the weight of the grounds."
1013,"This makes a small but significant difference to calculations. So what is it? Do we simply calculate differently for espresso and pourover? In which case, where does Aeropress sit for example?"
1014,"Apart from the principle, it's causing me pain because I like to have a spreadsheet (for pourover) where I can input a desired quantity out, and it will tell me how much coffee grounds I need, and importantly how much water I have to put in, having selected my ratio. If we're treating it like espresso, this is easy:"
1015,"a = volume of coffee out in ml (inputted by the user, i.e. me)"
1016,"b = ratio (i.e. 15, 16, 17, 18 etc, selected by me)"
1017,"c = grounds in, i.e. a/b"
1018,"d = water in, i.e. a + (2*c)"
1019,"This works beautifully except it's not quite correct. In the case of pourover, with the large quantities involved, it doesn't make too much of a difference. But with an Aeropress, the difference becomes noticeable."
1020,"I can't at the moment (although I'm sure I will do) work out a way to create the above spreadsheet where the ratio is calculated on the amount of water in (i.e. the correct way for pourover?), and I'm still able to input the desired coffee out. It may seem easy:"
1021,c = d/b
1022,However d references c so it's a cyclical reference or whatever it's called. Anyone who can work this out for me would be saving me a lot of time and sweat!
1023,"All of this is confounded by the fact that I still don't know what the correct way of doing it is for pourover. Do we calculate the ratio based on the water in, or by the coffee out?"
1024,.....
1025,"As an addendum, I know it's not really about religiously sticking to ratios and recipes, it's all about starting from something fairly standard and working out what you like. And I know there are many, many other factors (grind, temperature immediately come to mind) which I haven't mentioned that make a huge difference. I do experiment, but if I make the perfect coffee I want to note down the ratio, and I want to be doing it properly."
1026,"Hi there, I'm from India."
1027,"My dad recently got ground coffee from Vietnam for me. Initially, I was planning to buy a Vietnamese Phin filter, but then I realised that the South Indian Coffee filter is very similar to it."
1028,"The only difference that I can see is that South indian filters are available in much bigger sizes and can therefore produce larger quantities of decoction at a time.  Another difference is that, South indian filters have decoction collectors with them unlike the Vietnamese Phin filters."
1029,"I'm a noob at brewing coffee, so please let me know if I'm missing something."
1030,I bloom my coffee using my French press and noticed that my coffee output is decreased by the amount of water I added in the bloom.

1038,Why are Chemex so praised?
1039,"I used to wonder why my coffee was almost always sour. It seems other people have the same problem, so I just want to share my story, my frustration, and my happy discovery."
1040,I'm also curious how other people learned the difference between sour vs stale? And what words you do you use to describe those flavors?
1041,"TL;DR- bought a good grinder, bought fresh roasted coffee. Learned that stale sour is different than under extracted sour. Also, old beans stale is different than old grounds stale."
1042,"For my home coffee, I used to grind finer and finer and brew hotter and hotter and still have problems with sourness... I was buying grocery store coffee, sometimes preground, and using a cheapo javapresse ceramic burr hand grinder. Also, I'm the only coffee drinker in the house, so it could take weeks or months to use up a bag."
1043,"Recently, I learned that what I thought was sour coffee was stale coffee. Under extracted sourness is different. It has a mouth puckering sour feel, not just a sour taste. I'm even thinking that roasted too long ago vs. ground too long ago staleness have different stale flavors."
1044,"My timeline of realization went like this: Early December- gifted a bag of roasted in October Intelligentsia beans, put them in the freezer knowing I would get a good grinder soon. Mid December- bought some specialty coffee locally about 5 days after it was roasted. Had the coffee shop grind it for me. I started keeping a journal of tasting notes and brewing methods."
1045,"That local coffee tasted a bit harsh for a day or two, then leveled off and was good, then lost its aroma, but tasted okay. This over a week or two. Then I got my 1ZPresso grinder and thawed out the Intelligentsia beans. They were good but just a touch ashy on the finish, if steeped too long. I mostly brewed those for the next couple weeks."
1046,"Then I busted the local coffee back out a couple days ago, so it was ground almost a month ago. No aroma to the grounds. Suuuuper sour coffee like I used to always make. Tastes like vegetables. Tastes I don't know, green?  Undrinkable. Tossed it all out."
1047,"Went back to Intelligentsia, ashy/roasty flavour more evident. Tried a new aeropress recipe with much coarser grind. Totally different! Not as ashy, but.... sour. My mouth felt like I ate sour candy. So that's what sour means!"
1048,"The beans that were roasted months ago tasted ashy-roasty-sour when fresh ground, the fresh roasted but ground weeks ago coffee tasted plant-sour, and the under extracted coffee tasted (and felt) sour candy sour. Only the last one had the notably different mouthfeel."
1049,"Maybe time past roast has more of an effect on purely internal/ time based chemical changes, while time past grinding has more of an effect on just oxidation type changes due to the increased surface area?"
1050,"I'm starting to experiment and make bad coffee on purpose now. Too hot water, too cold, waaaaay too much coffee, or extreme grind sizes. I hope I learn more about defects this way, and I hope this story helps someone!"
1051,"hi, I just made my first cup of coffee with my Chemex. I used a light roasted blend about one month from roast date. I used approximately 60 clicks on my 1zpresso Q2 and 24.5g of beans at a ratio of 1:15 or 1:18 with water from my Electric kettle poured to my Hario air drip kettle and then poured on the coffee. The coffee I got was bitter with a tinge of sourness towards the end of the cup. I would like some feedback as well as any recipes or Youtube links that you could recommend. I am in the process of getting a Brewista temperature controlled kettle. I would like to improve my technique before then."

1065,"I've been making coffee with Aeropress for about two years now. I've always gone by the James Hoffman or Tim Wendlebow recipe, with a lot of different variations to both. More or less, my coffee has always tasted the same. It's not bad, but it's not that good either. Even a pricey Ethiopian will basically just taste like a decent medium roast - not tea-like, no fruityness, etc."
1066,"The other day I went to a coffee shop and the barista was making Aeropress for himself. He offered me a small cup for free. It was amazing and completely different from anything I've ever made. Like not even comparable at all to the coffee I always make. He walked me through the recipe. I forget the details, but he did the inverted method, with blooming, and a fair amount of stirring. Basically, it was a complicated recipe."
1067,"So this brings me to wonder.. I thought the Hoffman/ Wendlebow recipes were ""simple but make a tasty cup""? I thought the more involved recipes weren't really worth it? This is what I thought I've read online. But now I'm thinking, I definitely need to go inverted, start blooming.. all the works. Why are these recipes always recommended when I just had a cup of coffee using a recipe that completely blow these ones out of the water?"
1068,"My understanding is that it's just a vessel that holds a paper filter, there is nothing ""unique"" about them. So why are people so obsessed with using them/claim they make better coffee? (I have nothing against them, I just think I'm missing something)"

1070,"Most flavours end up being ""sour"" to me, thus I end up only liking bold flavors and darker roasts. What makes a good dark roast, and what do I need to look out for?"
1071,"Made an account just to post this. I ordered a Baratza Encore grinder during their recent sale, and while setting it up, I was disappointed to find the black silicone gasket missing with a smaller part in its place. I reached out to Baratza support and almost immediately got confirmation that this is a new and improved design that’s easier to use. I wanted to share this in case anyone else freaks out for a second after opening their new grinder. Pictures sent to me by support: https://imgur.com/a/uqwteNU"
1072,"Hi,"
1073,"I've been into specialty coffee for years now, but while I love trying out new flavours, for coffee I only really like a small aspect of it. I like my coffee black, as an espresso or in an (oatmilk) cappuccino. I love the taste of strong coffee, without being overly bitter of acidic. When I try out specialty coffees that are supposed to be berry-like (Guatamalan, Kenyan, etcetera), they are just too sour to me. I like bolder flavours: chocolate, oats, caramel."
1074,It feels like the offerings for bold coffee is limited (if I want to go beyond supermarket coffees). What should I look for when I want a coffee suitable for both espresso and drip coffee? There must be more flavours to explore!

1095,"So, if you add the M2 Cone Burr (https://shop.baratza.com/cone-burr-2) to the Encore, are you close to matching performance (or at least grind consistency) of the Virtuoso+?"

1100,I got this Delonghi Dedica EC685M as a gift: https://bre.is/Zs6cNyeU
1101,"I know it's not the best espresso machine, but it's an OK-ish one for starters at home, from what I've read. I made a couple of modifications to it, including replacing the pressurized portafilter with a non-pressurized bottomless one."
1102,"I also bought the Breville/Sage Smart Grinder Pro. And now, no matter what I do with the grind size, my coffee taste sour and I can't change the weight of the coffee i get out."
1103,"The coffee I'm using is called Salto, from the Yellow Bourbon variety, 1230 AMSL"
1104,I grind about 15-16g of ground coffee
1105,"Then about 25 seconds of brewing time.  I count from the moment I press the brew button... at first it makes a noise but nothing comes out, it stops, then the noise comes back again and a few seconds later the brewed coffee comes out. Then the noise stops, the coffee continues to come down, and I press stop when the coffee starts dripping drop by drop."
1106,I get about 24-25 grams of brewed coffee.
1107,"I started with a grind size of 21 on my grinder, then made it finder to 19, then 17, then made it more coarse to 24. No matter what I do, I get about 24-25 grams of brewed coffee, whereas I'm trying to hit 32g."
1108,"And the taste is sour.  Every time. And the coarser it is, of course the more sour it is."
1109,"And I'm pretty sure if I grind finer, I will have even less coffee output."
1110,"So, what should I do to improve my brewing?  Hoping for some advice from people who know what's going on."
1111,"We just retired our 12-year-old Rancilio Rocky grinder, upgraded to the Sette 270i for finer control of grind and for the Wi weight-dispensing feature. The Sette has a load cell that weighs the portafilter, and then operates the grinder to dispense a preset weight in grams. It's awesome. There is very little coffee left in the machine, because the coffee flow is pretty straight through. I think it is going to be superior to the Rocky, which collected a fair amount coffee debris and needed a labor-intensive cleaning every two to three months to keep running."
1112,"The Sette self trains to decide when to cut the drive motor off. That's required because the motor costs and coffee keeps dropping for a short time after the motor is switched off. It takes a couple cycles to hit the preset weight accurately, and on the training cycles it may stop a couple of times and need to be restarted to get to the desired output. Suddenly our grinder seemed to be in continuous self-train mode, though. Would never get to the desired weight. I'm shaking my head, and even read through the manual. Could not figure out what was going on."
1113,"After a while I noticed that my wife put a nice plastic tray underneath the grinder to collect debris. Hmmm. I removed the plastic tray and set the grinder on the solid countertop. Then it worked flawlessly. Seems that if the grinder is vibrating because it is on a soft base, that interferes with the weight measurement. I suspect that this will apply to any weight-based espresso grinder. They probably all need solid foundations."
1114,"I've been working on a batch of Guatemala Antigua beans from a local specialty coffee shop for about 2-3 weeks. For the first week or so, they were blooming quite nice and evenly with 2:1 water to grinds at 45 seconds in a Chemex. The resulting brews were so delicious!"
1115,"However the last week or so, I've noticed a harsh/almost-burned smell coming from the beans that wasn't there before and the blooms are SO lumpy and 2-3 times larger than previously. The brews have become much more acrid/smokey/bitter and much less tasty. I took a break from them for 3 days and suddenly, terrible. What gives?? I've started double blooming just to get the bed to flatten and reduce some foam."
1116,"I store them in an Airscape at room temperature, out of the sun, and freshly grind them using an Ode2 at a medium grind setting (though I've been playing with coarseness to get brew time where I want it). Every other variable has been roughly the same. So why the sudden change in the bloom and how can coffee suddenly become gassier? Afaik, they should have released most of their C02 by now."
1117,TLDR: My 2-3 week old beans are suddenly causing a much harsher brew with less delicious subtle flavors and blooms are 2-3 times their original size and very foamy.
1118,UPDATE: made some changes to get it closer to where it was a couple weeks ago. More info in comments

1125,"I've had this rechargeable burr grinder for close to a year now. It took me a few weeks to figure out how to get the grind setting where I wanted it because there's only a little plastic wing nut and at the finest setting it was still perkalator-coarse. I have a pour over, so I wanted it finer than that. I figured out I could tighten the nut a little further with a wrench, and I've gotten the good stuff ever since."
1126,"My mom has been staying with me this past week so I've been putting in more beans to grind than I usually do, and it's back to being coarse again. I tried to see about using a wrench to tighten it, but it's not working. I'm worried I may have pushed this cheap little grinder beyond its limits and it will never be fine again."
1127,Does anyone know anything about this brand of burr grinder? Should I just give it up and get something new? These coarse grounds make my coffee so weak and bitter. I can't live like this!
1128,"In espresso is easy. If 17gr go in, 32 should come out in ~28 seconds. Cool. Try once, or twice, adjust the ginder setting and perhaps ""waste"" 34 gr of coffee on the process."
1129,"Cold brew requires 50gr of coffee. I fear I might need a couple tries to get it right and thus waste too much coffee until I hit the sweet spot. Is there any way to avoid this? Also, how can I know when a cold brew is good? Taste wise I have no references so it's kind of hard to measure it."
1130,"EDIT: So the general consensus is that it's hard to ruin a cold brew and whatever the result is, it will be drinkable and a good learning experience."
1131,"I have a followup question though. Water. I use tap water for the espresso machine and I live in an area with quite heavy water (Barcelona). I intended to try cold brew with bottled water, though it makes me wonder if I should use bottled water for espresso or tap water is fine for cold brew."
1132,"Finally, I just checked the manual of the glass bottle with filter that I bought for cold brew. It states to use 55gr (some of you asked why 50 gr, here is why). What I also found interesting is that it's stated that once cold brew is done, it should be drinked in 2-3 days or the resulting brew will oxidised. Opinions on this?"
1133,Pretty new to this level of good coffee.I like to think I have a more-than-average palate cause I like tasting and trying different wines and beer and been doing that for a few years now.
1134,"I got a new coffee from a local roastery. Kenyan, medium-light roast. Did a few brews, and I just don't seem to like it overall. Currently 10 days old (roasted 7/1/23).I also have, from the same roastery, a light roast from El Salvador. This is a coffee I've bought before and like quite a lot. The bag I currently have is 42 days old (roasted 6/12/22)."
1135,"Since I'm struggling with the new Kenyan beans, I decided to cup the two. Used James Hoffmann's videos as guides for prep and tasting."
1136,"Surprisingly, the Kenyan is objectively better. Nicer aroma, sweetness, body, etc. The El Salvador is ok, the flavours I know are there, but they're very faint. Even a bit stale."
1137,"So, what gives? Is 40+ days too old? I suppose I need to cup closely roasted coffees for the comparison to be accurate, right?I'll try my usual Aeropress brew with the El Salvador coffee, and see how it is."
1138,"Obviously, I need to refine my brew method for the Kenyan, since it tasted way better than my previous brews with it. Most of which were astringent. More with the Aeropress than the V60. I'll try coarser and reduce brew time. Do I need to use more coffee? Up it to 20gr from 18gr for 300ml?"
1139,"I ordered $300 in gear from Fellow two weeks ago (Jan 2). One part of the order showed up that week but the other didn't so I sent support an e-mail asking about it. They told me that the order would ship Jan 9 because their team was focusing on preparing for 2023. It never shipped, and I followed up again. They said they would look into it and get back to me but never did."
1140,"Since it's been 2 weeks and I want a coffee maker and they can't provide an ETA, I asked for them to cancel the order and refund me. They are now saying they think the package is lost somewhere ""in transit"" (despite UPS never having received it) and that Fellow does not offer order cancellations."
1141,I feel like they let me down big time. Just warning everyone else out there.
1142,"I know they have really strong domestic demand so not much is exported, but I'm wondering if there are any good roasters in the US who manage to snag some?"
1143,For reference been pretty happy with this coffee maker so far buy suddenly getting a burnt flavoring to it and really haven't changed anything on my end.
1144,"Machine:  Tried cleaning/descaled with a formula as well as running some watered down vinegar through the cleaning cycle, no real change."
1145,"Coffee:  No real change here.  I order from Happy Mug and just generally get their single origin lightest roasts which appear to be rotating roughly the same beans.  Medium grind on my burr grinder, 56 grams for 32oz of water."
1146,Anyone have any ideas? I know that a drip machine isn't going to outperform pour over but it wasn't giving these burnt notes until recently.
1147,"I’m pretty new to the coffee game and also don’t have a ton of discretionary income to try the vast world of specialty coffee firsthand. I recently got an Ethiopian light roast and I think if I put some soda water next to my cup of joe it would’ve turned into la croix - crazy flavorful and fruity! Nothing else has compared to those beans for a unique, distinctly flavorful cup. What do you all recommend for a great light roast? Also, what beans have you all tried that had a unique flavor? I’m guessing origin of the bean has a greater influence than the roaster - is that right? I usually use a chemex but also have an aeropress."
1148,I use a Chemex to make a pot of coffee using supermarket beans every day and it’s consistently amazing. But whenever someone gets me a really nice bag of beans as a gift I end up wasting almost the whole bag on bad coffee.
1149,I’ve cleaned the grinder and fiddled with the coarseness but can never get good results. The setting I use with my supermarket beans works with almost any kind of cheap beans and produces great results but with any speciality bean that grind results in a weird grind that is visibly far too coarse but extracts super slowly like it’s far too fine.
1150,The only thing I’ve ever noticed is that speciality beans are quite often ever so slightly smaller in size. But I cannot figure out how to compensate for this and am sick of wasting nice gift beans.
1151,Any advice?
1152,"Ie. A page or two for each new coffee you try, details, etc.? Saw a streamer I watch keep a dairy of bud strains she tries and thought it would be neat to do."
1153,"I've been exploring the world of specialty coffee for a little while now. I have a variety of brewing methods and I love buying from local roasters. I also work for Starbucks, and as part of my benefits I get a free pound of coffee per week. I've saved a lot of money by using Sbux coffee as a daily driver and buying nicer coffees as I go. While I know Sbux coffee isn't going to ever be top tier quality, how do I maximize the cup I get out of it? I currently own a french press, an aeropress, and a Hario switch. (Unfortunately my markouts only work on the core coffees, I have to buy the reserve blends.)"
1154,"I purchased a Flair espresso maker to use at home for espresso. My entry point into home coffee was a Nespresso machine years ago, so I was yearning for espresso again after using an aeropress for over a year now."
1155,"The videos of puck prep and bottomless portafilters on YouTube swayed me to the Flair, it is one of the cheapest entry points into home espresso."
1156,"I've had it two days now and I realised, atleast for me, home espresso is unfortunately too much effort to get right."
1157,"By this I mean, there are too many variables. The beans have to fresh (within 4-5 weeks old), the temperature of the group head has to be correct, the grind size has to be perfect, the flow has to be consistent to get a shot in ~35 seconds. As much as I love the process of making a great cup of coffee, I think this is quite excessive."
1158,"Would I have a better time with a semi automatic machine vs the Flair? Probably, but the above variables are still in play."
1159,"So, I'll probably sell the Flair and look to a brewer type machine, back to the trusty aeropress I go! Maybe something like the sage precision brewer would be best, as I've started to prefer a longer cup now vs a pure espresso shot."
1160,What are your thoughts? Is the sage brewer the right way to go? Is there something better on the market?
1161,"I always see people talk about pour-overs,  espresso, drip coffee, french-press, moka-pot, etc.. basically other methods of making coffee. But I've never seen Phin filtered coffee talked about that much outside of Vietnam or Vietnamese communities. Is there a reason as to why they're not as popular as other methods of brewing coffee? Or is this just a case of what I'm able to see within my community and in the internet?"

1177,"I have been mostly an espresso drinker for the past 15 years but wanting to get more into pour over. I like lighter roast fruit forward profiles, especially Ethiopian. I have the la marzocco monthly subscription that has a bit of variety in the light-medium range."
1178,"I have a chemex and a clever dripper. I have a df83 grinder with SSP HU burrs, a niche (not sure if I’m keeping it), and a Fiorenzato F4e nano that I want to modify to run 64mm burrs in and use primarily for drip, but also for the occasional experimentation to compare and contrast with the df83 (and the Niche if I keep it)."
1179,"Any thoughts on which 64mm burrs would be a good contrast from what I already have, given my tastes?"
1180,"I personally think that for grinders, after the C40, or perhaps even the 1zPresso JX Pro, the improvements in your cup, at least for pourover, will be minimal. For kettles, well since it doesn’t really affect anything that much, I would say anything after a Hario Buono would be pointless. How about for you espresso-lovers out there?"
1181,So this weekend I finally got my needles (0.4mm) in and printed out a wdt tool to see what all the hype is about. I brewer roughly 10 shots and (apart from the first) they all had suffered from a overly high flow rate. 40 grams at roughly about 18 seconds. The taste actually improved considerably to previous (seems more balanced/sweet) however there was little to no crema and the shot wasn't as thick as before.I tried both increasing dose (from 16 to 18g) and decreasing (2 and 3 clicks down) grind size both seperately and together but neither seemed to actually affect the output rate that much. Initially I suspected channeling but the puck seemed fine (but since I don't have a bottomless portafilter I can't verify further).
1182,"My main question would be, wether any of you noticed anything similar? And what would you suggest to change/look at next?"
1183,"I’m planning a trip to Costa Rica and was hoping to come back with a lot of coffee. Then I realized I could just buy it at the source, instead of a cafe. Did a search and found a lot of coffee farms open to the public. Has anyone done something like this before?"
1184,"Has anyone tried to take apart their grinder and add a wire connecting the burrs, or another metal point that the burrs contact, to the earth ground in the grinder or maybe an external ground plug?"
1185,"I’m an electrical engineer and whenever we work with circuit boards we have to use anti static mats to work on the boards. We also have to wear an anti static strap so that no static from our skin will damage something on the circuit board. I’m thinking that Fellow did this with the ode2 to eliminate the static and it seems like an easy, trivial solution but I can’t find anyone talking about online."
1186,"I’m using the V60 method he uploaded recently to his YouTube channel. For 15 g of beans he recommends 50 g of water for the bloom, with a swirl after 10 - 15 seconds. Problem is even with 75 g of water, my grounds are so dry I can’t properly swirl or stir them. I’m new to this, and I have no idea what’s going on. Any advice?"
1187,"EDIT: u/Einridi pointed out my mistake. The recipe says to swirl at 10 to 15 seconds. I was counting from the end of the initial pour instead of the beginning, leaving too much time for the water to drain. Thanks, everyone!"
1188,So I see online that there seems to be an agreed ratio range between 50 and 60 grams of coffee grounds per liter of water recommended for brewing.
1189,I've been brewing using a Bodum pour over set for a while now and just using the mesh filter it comes with as I find the paper filter seems to not taste as good and I don't mind a little silt in my coffe.
1190,"Until recently, I'd been using a LOT less grounds for this method, and imo getting way better coffee. Closer to a ratio of 30g per liter of water, maybe even 25g."
1191,"It seems to me that when I use the, ""Correct,"" ratio I get bitter crap and when I use half that amount I get coffee that actually tastes like something. When I use the smaller amount I seem to get a lot more of the coffee oils - like I can see a foam on top and a clear layer of oil on top of the brewed coffee."
1192,What am I doing wrong? Do I just suck? Are my tastebuds broken? I don't get it.
1193,Please advise!
1194,I bought some really nice beans at a local coffee shop today. The man behind the counter recommended waiting 30 min after grinding before brewing for best result. Roasted one week ago.
1195,Have anyone heard of this approach before?
1196,Recently acquired a Bunn G1 and am looking to make the Bunnzilla mods and I have two questions.
1197,Does anyone have a source for the press fit adapter for the ditting 804s or should I just go with SSP at this point?
1198,"What parts do I need to add the trifecta plate functionality? Just the detent plate and the decal or do I have to get the whole front knob assembly, augur etc? Appreciate the advice!"
1199,"I recently bought a bag of washed, light roasted columbian beans in a bag boasting flavors of apricot, mango and peach. I've been to this specific roaster before and have had great results with their light roasts, reliably getting the notes they put on their bags, but not this time."
1200,"The coffee tastes acidic, there is not much in terms of roast flavor as one would expect, but also not much else. I've tried brewing it at the roaster recommended 95°C, I've varied my grind sizes, I've ventured above and below with temps, getting up to boiling and down to 85°C, but apart from introducing some bitterness and muddiness when going finer, nothing much has changed."
1201,"I use an aeropress, a Kinu M47 Phoenix grinder, soft water that works great with other beans, and a 60g/l ratio of coffee to water. Maybe someone in this community has an idea what I could try to further troubleshoot this coffee, because I really want those fruity notes. I would be very grateful if anyone has an idea or two."
1202,Edit: some key questions I have:
1203,What grind setting would you use? I usually venture north of just coarser than espresso.
1204,"What temperatures do you usually use for light roasts? I've seen very different recommendations floating around, some saying it should be boiling while other roasters have told me to use 80°C water for their light roasts."
1205,What might I be missing?
1206,This might be a more appropriate question for a chemistry subreddit but I'm wondering what I can do with some super super high psi rated equipment.
1207,"What would happen if you took extremely light roast or even un roasted coffee and were to immerse it in 450f water at 500psi? Would the coffee immediately vaporize or have a really awful taste or could you ""sous vide"" the coffee beans under the extreme temps? The difficulty would be safely removing the coffee from the boiler or pressure chamber as the steam would cause instant 3rd degree burns and become superheated rapidly."
1208,I'm sort of in a rut and would like to try some new stuff.  I've gone through all of my local roasters and tried many of the bigger national roasters.  Where does everyone go (besides here) to learn about new roasters or even specific bean reviews?  Does something like whiskybase exist for coffee?

1218,"I’m using a small 300ml gooseneck pouring kettle. I’m wondering how much does it matter. I noticed that the spout was noticeably shorter than say the Fellow Stagg EKG, or even the Hario Buono. I recently got a Comandante C40 and I want to get the best out of it."
1219,"I had 6g of beans left at the end of a bag, not enough to make a pour over, so I ground them, threw them in my Hario Switch, and made them with my usual recipe, just scaled down to 100g of water. It came out really good! It actually brought out more of the tasting notes than when I used the V60, which was stronger on the fruity notes but less on the Earl Grey notes that are supposed to be present. That's one thing I like about the Switch, you can use the same recipe for a wide range of doses and coffee types and still get good results. That probably applies to other immersion brewing methods as well. Another time I did this with only 3g of a different bag of coffee, and that came out good too."
1220,What do you do when you get to the end of a bag?
1221,"Hi all! I’m a Chemical Engineering student doing research on removing compounds from coffee during the brewing process to alter the taste. Coffee has over 1000+ VOCs, or volatile organic compounds that effect taste and smell. I want to focus on one or two that specifically impact the bitter coffee profile. Does anyone know of a specific compound that does this?"
1222,"Do you try to match them closest in draw down time, and then compare taste? To me that seems to have a lot of variables, including if one grinder produces more fines than another at the same average grind size"
1223,"Or you could match closest in taste, and then look for slight taste nuances between them as well as draw down time differences as cues - but this seems even less precise."
1224,So what’s the best way to do it?
1225,"For reference, I’m trying to compare my df64 with SSP MP burrs with my 1zpresso K series grinder - for pour over only"
1226,"Started to make coffee at home to save some money as I'm in a tighter spot at the moment, and I didn't have a coffee maker, so I got a French press from Ikea (I think it was around 10-15$?) it makes pretty good coffee, though, I've noticed sometimes the finer grounds come through in to the cup. I don't notice them texture wise, so it doesn't bother me."
1227,"One thing I've noticed however when I was learning to use it, was that EVERYONE says to NOT use pre ground coffee and to use beans instead because it is fresher and whatnot. Seems fair, but I want to know how much of a difference it is, as the only grinders in my price range are hand grinders, but I've got arthritis and my other grinder is enough of a problem. I'd get one of the similarly cheap electric grinders, but I've also heard they ruin beans and Arnt worth it?"
1228,"I guess what I'm wondering, would it still be worth it to get a 10$ hand grinder and suffer the pain each morning to grind it, or to just keep either getting pre ground or having it ground at the store? I've been happy enough with what I'm getting with pre ground coffee (Balzac's in this case) but if it's a massive difference I might just get one. Otherwise I'll likely wait till I'm working again and save up for an electric grinder. Also, if anyone knows of cheaper coffee grinders thst are good for people with arthritis let me know!"
1229,"I just did the upgrade from an m3 burr to and m2 burr on my encore. When I reassembled, the beans weren’t feeding correctly into the burr set—for some reason they were kind of floating in the space between the inner and outer burr. I googled like crazy, couldn’t find anything. Googled the problem again with “Reddit” in the search, still nothing."
1230,"So you, lone person who are having this problem—you put the washers back incorrectly. For me, when I knocked out the drive shaft, the washers went everywhere and I couldn’t figure out where they went. I gave it my best guess. It was incorrect."

1237,"this might be a weird post, so apologies if my question seems absurd."
1238,"i notice that when i have my coffee, about midway through i am finding a 'tannins' kind of mouth-feel. that dryness you get from a glass of wine or black tea. not to the same extent, but somewhat. after my cup, my mouth feels 'bad breath' like, and that dryness remains until i eat something or enough time passes."
1239,"now i know coffee doesn't have any true 'tannins', so this 'tannic like quality' obviously isn't tannins, thus making it harder to understand, combat, search for, and resolve."
1240,"anyone else experience this, and any ideas how to combat it? i would prefer not to eat before or during my coffee (intermittent fasting)"

1257,"I bought an expensive 250g bag of single origin Ethiopian coffee from a nice coffee/tea store local to me, roasted the day before I bought it."
1258,"But it says on the bag that the coffee was actually harvested a full year prior, December 21. Isn't that... Pretty fuckin long ago? Just can't seem to Google an answer on this since all the answers I get refer to age AFTER roasting, which I already know."
1259,"Taste wise it was unfortunately only ok. Not really my style, a little too tea-like, fairly high acidity and pretty much nothing else. Taste notes of ""sweet,"" ""red grapes"" and Earl Grey, haha."
1260,"I really hate compromises, and would love to have the best cup each time I go for one. However, as good as batch brewers are, they still feel like a compromise compared to the potential of manual pour overs."
1261,"This doesn't feel like it should be the case, so why is it?"
1262,"I had been using the Gen 1 everyday for a while now. Drip, pour-over, French press are my usual suspects. No espresso of course. The Gen 1 was fantastic, but it did have some flaws that have been covered many times: Static (pretty bad without RDT), hopper having larger beans get stuck, gen 1 Burrs being so so."
1263,*Edit - I am no expert. Just your average coffee lover that made a financially irresponsible decision.
1264,Gen 2 initial impression:
1265,Looks - About the same. No big difference.
1266,Hopper - Fixed. I have tried beans that often get stuck and have had no problems. The increased size is lovely for when I have guests over and want to make larger amounts of coffee.
1267,"Grind - Still very pleasant sounding, but it does have a slightly higher pitch and metallic nature that is a touch less pleasing to the ears. Seems about as quick to grind as the Gen 1."
1268,"Gen 2 Burrs - It does seem more uniform and performs better at the lower grind setting by the naked Eye than Gen 1. I tend to drink light and medium coffee and have found the taste to be slightly less muddy and sweeter than before, but I am no expert here. Again slightly higher pitched and metallic, but not as much as the SSP."
1269,"Static - Night and day difference without RDT. Before it was a mess without RDT, lots of retention, little tiny zap when you grabbed the cup, harder to pour out of the container. Now in the Gen 2 it is a lovely experience."
1270,Cup - Slightly bigger with a slightly easier to remove lid. Not a huge change but nice again for larger batches when guests stay over.
1271,"Knocker - Why am I even mentioning this? Sounds silly, but I find the new knocker to sound much nicer. Far less metallic and ""?clangy"". Also don't have to use as much with the new anti-static bits."
1272,Knob - Still has steps. Lighter touch to it. Meh.. kind of a push. Both have a nice feel.
1273,Overall impression:
1274,Largest difference is of course the new Gen 2 Burrs which can be had for ~$80 dollars for Gen 1 machines. Easy install.
1275,"Next big thing is the anti-static bits. ""You loser just RDT those grounds my dude!"" The problem is often guests and family use the grinder, and I don't expect them to RDT so naturally the coffee station turns into a hurricane of grounds (which I don't blame them for as the machine is a static beast)."
1276,"Again for guests, the larger hopper and cup are nice features especially after the many times family came to find me for beans getting stuck in the old hopper."
1277,Do I recommend the upgrade? It depends.
1278,"If you are generally the only one using it, I'd just upgrade to the Gen 2 Burrs or the SSP and continue to RDT."
1279,"If you are tired of the mess/static, many others use the machine, and/or are able to sell the Gen 1, then perhaps."
1280,Cheers from a rambling coffee noob!
1281,"Hello all, first time posting here and have a question I can't seem to find an answer for."
1282,I use a Chemex to brew 0.5L of coffee in the morning and drink it over the next 3-5 hours from a Thermos. I use pre-ground coffee.
1283,I have been thinking about grinding the beans myself in the morning but I'm not sure if the benefits will be worth the extra effort since it will sit in a Thermos for a while.
1284,The beans I would be grinding would be bought from a supermarket until I'd want to try something else.
1285,Should I start grinding my own beans?
1286,Some more info: I started to make my own coffee in order to save money. I brew 20-30g coffee per 0.5L and would like to remain under a dollar a cup. So a cheap quality hand grinder recommendation would also be appreciated. Thanks in advance!
1287,"My partner has never been a huge fan of coffee, but it never bothered them to have it in the house. At the beginning of 2021 we both contracted Covid and they developed parosmia (loss of taste and smell), and it's just finally starting to get better. Unfortunately, the smell of coffee is really strong and she says it's the worst smell ever right now. It will wake her up out of a dead sleep and take her hours to fall back asleep. Obviously I don't want to make her miserable and feeling nauseous all the time, but I also love my coffee in the morning."
1288,Is there anything I can do to reduce the odor? Would a single cup Kuerig be more beneficial than brewing a full pot? Any other alternatives I could try?
1289,What’s good r/Coffee!
1290,"I have been spending a lot of time this past year/year and a half experimenting with cocktails. This past week my partner has been on call with work, being responsible and staying off the booze. So it got me thinking, “What kinda fun drinks can I make with coffee?! Especially using some of my cocktail gear.” I don’t have a full espresso setup so steamed milk drinks were off the table."
1291,"Well, it didn’t take long for the Caffe/Espresso Shakerato to pop into my brain. I’ve seen stuff about it before but never had a shaker on hand or any cool glassware to serve it in. I love drinking cocktails with egg white, so the bubbly/frothy result you get from these drinks was really intriguing to me."
1292,"Well, yesterday was the day. It was 1pm-ish and I was looking for a quick afternoon treat so figured it was perfect timing. I looked at a few recipes and the first one that showed up was THIS ONE from Serious Eats. Might not be the most traditional place for coffee culture but I use a ton of their recipes"
1293,Their recipe was:
1294,4 ounces ice cubes (about 4 to 6 cubes)
1295,1/2 ounce (1 tablespoon; 15g) sugar
1296,2 fluid ounces (60ml) freshly made hot espresso
1297,"Add ice and sugar to a cocktail shaker. Pour hot espresso on top, seal shaker, and shake vigorously until thoroughly chilled, 10 to 20 seconds."
1298,"Strain iced espresso into a cocktail glass, coupe, or other glass vessel and serve right away."
1299,"How I make the ""Espresso"""
1300,I can’t make espresso at home (not much counter space in my 1 bedroom) but I do have a Fellow Prismo  that helps me get CLOSE to espresso.
1301,My recipe is as follows:
1302,18g finely ground coffee (not espresso grind but close. Like you would for a Moka Pot)
1303,85g water straight off the boil
1304,"Add Prismo to bottom of the aeropress and add in coffee. Pour water, straight off the boil to 85g. Stir or swirl to incorporate"
1305,Steep for ~45 sec to 1 min. Plunge into cup.
1306,Issue with Sugar
1307,"If you're adding sugar to the recipe, I feel like syrups are always better. Obviously the espresso is hot and will likely dissolve based on how hard I shook this drink. But I'd rather not take that risk."
1308,I also ALWAYS have various syrups on hand at home and yesterdays was a Rich (2:1) Demerara Syrup in the amount of 0.5oz. I like the extra molasses-y flavours that the Demerara brings out.
1309,My Experiments
1310,I made one run of the Shakerato and it was passable. I used a bit of an older coffee in my current collection and feel like that may have been part of the problem.
1311,"But then I used a coffee I felt would fit a little better for the drink. It was an anaerobic washed Bolivian, seen HERE. I also expressed some lemon zest/peel over the top (like you do with a lot of cocktails). HERE is the end result."
1312,The Lemon was a Game Changer
1313,"I CANNOT TELL YOU ENOUGH how much the lemon improved this drink. The bright/citrusy aroma you get from the lemon just adds a whole other dimension to this drink. When I first had heard of lemon and coffee pairing I only scoffed at it, as it sounded ridiculous. But, let me tell you, adding the lemon to this drink makes it so, so, SO much better. You get the aroma of the lemon up front, the molasses-y sweetness from the Demerara up front and the more roasty/chocolatey notes from the coffee on the back end, along with the more fermented notes from this anaerobic coffee."
1314,My Recipe
1315,The recipe I am currently sitting on (which may be change in the future) is as follows:
1316,"1/2 ounce – Rich Demerara syrup (feel free to drop to ¼oz or remove if you want it less sweet) (note 1, note 2)"
1317,2 fluid ounces (60ml) freshly made hot espresso or aeropress coffee brewed as above
1318,1 strip of lemon zest (for expressing on drink)
1319,"Add ice and syrup to a cocktail shaker. Pour hot espresso/aeropress coffee on top, seal shaker, and shake vigorously until thoroughly chilled, 10 to 20 seconds (kinda depending on your preferred level of froth/foam up top)."
1320,"Double strain into a cocktail glass (ie. coupe, Nick and Nora) or other glass vessel. I like to double straing"
1321,Express and garnish with a zest/peel of lemon.
1322,Enjoy right away!
1323,"Note 1 – I started with the 1/2oz of rich syrup as I feel it got closer to the original recipe I looked at, in terms of sweetness. However, my partner said it was a little bit sweet for her tastes. I do find my recipe to be somewhat dessert-y. You can reduce the sugar to suit your sweetness tastes. It’s mainly the surfactants in the coffee that create the foam. However, it is in my own experience that some sugar does help keep the structure of the foam a little more. But your mileage may vary!"
1324,"Note 2 – If you're feeling spicy, feel free to add to or sub your sugar for your favourite liquer (ie. Sambuca, Amaretto, Mr. Black Coffee Liquer even) or amaro (I like Averna, Montenegro or Braulio). It’s really up to you and your taste / sweetness / bitterness preferences!"
1325,"I’d love to know if any of you have better/different/other options for this kind of a drink. If you do, I’d love to hear about your recipe and methods!"
1326,"So I bought these lovely Ethopian beans from a good roaster nearby. I mostly use a V60. As many Ethiopian beans tend to do, the beans stall quite a bit. I assume that there are a lot of fines or a lot more than usual. For a grind setting that gives me approx. 2:30 brews for 250ml the brews take 3:30-4. It's the beans not the grinder, as I don't have this issue with other beans, unless I excessively agitate and I haven't had clogging issues with my Ode + SSP. Now, what do I do? When grinding where I usually do or slightly coarser it tastes fine (some sips quite nice actually) but I feel like there's something that mutes flavour. That makes sense because of the fines. Grinding substantially coarser doesn't really make sense I guess. It doesn't significantly decrease brew time (the long brew times come from stalling and not from a grind that is too fine, so grinding coarser hasn't really decreased brew times) and it makes it taste worse, because the non-fines are too coarse. Actually, those brews tasted the best so far that were at more or less the same grind setting as other beans I've used."
1327,"What I haven't gotten to try yet is use a recipe with little to no agitation or maybe a recipe that doesn't fill up the cone as much (more water in the cone that presses down increases fine migration afaik and therefore potential clogging). Would that work, what do you think? Do you have other strategies you use?"
1328,Does anyone have any tips on growing Coffee indoors? I am based in the UK.
1329,I have got this: https://www.thompson-morgan.com/p/coffee-plant/se-coffeaarabicaTM
1330,I would like any tips you guys have for getting fruit and flowers in 3-4 years.
1331,I would also appreciate if someone could point me in the direction of buying semi/mature coffee plants (or larger).
1332,"It's interesting. Not bad, not good."
1333,"My teapot stopped working this morning so I boiled the water in the microwave. However, when I took it out and poured it in the aeropress, it exploded, which AFAIK means the water was superheated."
1334,I was quite curious to see what the results would be like coffee-wise. I assumed the coffee would be more extracted.
1335,"That's exactly what happened. I actually kinda like underextracted coffee, so it's not to my liking. However, I've made that specific bean for a friend the other day, and she didn't like it, mentioning things that indicate she would have preferred it more extracted. I'm sure she would much prefer this version."
1336,"Probably don't try this at home, as superheater water can explode and burn you, but I think it was a cool experiment."
1337,"If a group head vibrated in a similar way to how the Mythos 1 does when grinding, would this break apart the channelling structures that inevitably form in a puck? Vibration always tends to redistribute a volume, but the question is whether that would be the case when dealing with >5 bars of pressure in a saturated mass. It could call for a higher or lower frequency or for oscillation on the Z or X/Y axis?"
1338,Definitely an impractical thing to integrate into espresso!
1339,I can also promise you I don't wanna hear my machine scream as if it was constipated while pulling a shot ( I'm lying to you)
1340,my attempt on helping with grind size
1341,Need help with coffee plant
1342,"I'm new to pour over and have been having a hard time figuring out what is meant when people talk about grind size. Some people talk in terms of medium Fine, medium,  medium Course. Some speak in terms of microns. Some in terms of course salt. I've also noticed that a lot of people are having the same questions and problems that I do. So with the help of the kruve grind size reference i have put together something that I hope will help people with this."
1343,"Tools needed: some measuring device, ruler, tape measure, hopefully something that has 1/16 marks. If it only has 1/8ths just divide it in half with a mark. "
1344,On the measure device 1/16th = .062 in./1600 microns 1/32nd = .031 in./800 microns
1345,Pour over range simplified Med. Course 1100 microns - .044 in. Med.                900 microns -  .035 in. Med. Fine.      700 microns -  .028 in.
1346,"With this info. You will see a medium course grind will be closer to 3/4 of the 1/16 mark, and the medium fine grind will be just under half of 1/16. I hope this makes some sense."
1347,"Greetings, everyone! I'm having some problems with my coffee plant. Leaves started drying out and browning, which they occasionally do in the winter, and I cut them off and trimmed the plant down. It never minds me doing that and continues growing."
1348,"However, this time I cut off more than usual, many leaves were brown, and now even the previously undamaged leaves are browning. They don't seem to be dry, just changing color for some reason. The new leaves also seem brittle. Something is definitely wrong. Can someone help me out?"
1349,"PS: I thought it was a moisture problem so I added a pebble tray yesterday, not sure it's visible in the picture."
1350,Regarding The copper version of Hario V60 02
1351,mold in coffee?
1352,Home roasting feels like the best kept open secret in coffee
1353,"How do you define ""Total Brew Time""?"
1354,"Why is the Gesha variety very consistent in its profile, while other varieties bring out more unique profiles?"
1355,"Has anyone in this thread used one? I used to brew in a regular plastic 02, but I thought the copper one looked really cool so I saved some money to buy one, and stashed away my plastic brewer in a drawer. I've since used the copper brewer for like 1.5 years and in that period I've more often than not been disappointed with how my coffee tasted. It was often inconsistent in taste even though I measured everything."
1356,Recently I read about how the coppers naturally great thermal conductivity might not be so good for making coffee(since it draws heat from the slurry) and started to take pre-heating the brewer more seriously. What I did was boil up around 500mg water and poured it onto the copper brewer when I had my grounds and water for the brewing ready. That made my coffee taste more consistent and quite good most of the time. A bit bland for my taste tho.
1357,"This week I found my old plastic Hario 02 and thought it would be fun to try brewing a cup with it since everyone seems to recommend it over any other 02 version. And damn it was effortlessly good, so I tried again and again brewing with it and always with a quite consistent and really good taste."
1358,"I've since then sadly renounced my love for the copper brewer and I've kept on using the plastic brewer. So my question is, has anyone else had this experience? Or have someone found a way to make coffee taste as good from the copper version as in the plastic one?"
1359,"I’ve been drinking coffee for years, and have had less than a few times where it just really tasted off, but I usually thought it might be the creamer going bad. Anyway, 99.9% of the time it tastes like coffee, normal."
1360,"Lately I’ve gotten into espresso and bought a Breville touch and I grind my beans a home, I just get whole beans from the store, so far I’ve used Peet’s beans and Starbucks beans, both tasted fine. I really like making my own at home. It’s become a really fun part of my morning. Haven’t had that mold flavor once."
1361,"On TikTok, of course I come across coffee content and I saw some post about mold in coffee? I have never experienced this. Some comments were saying “yeah right after a 400 degree roasting process” and I thought well, this obviously seems like promotion after they recommended some “organic Purity coffee mold free tested.”"
1362,"I don’t know, seemed kinda fake and I wanted to know if it’s really common for coffee beans to have mold? It seemed like some kind of fear tactic. This is like the first I’ve heard of it. I’ve heard about like bug particles, but uh, pretty sure that’s in everything so I try to ignore it lol."
1363,"UPDATE: To be clear I’m comparing the high ends coffee selection at a grocery to home roasting, and not comparing to fresh stuff from a roaster. Roaster direct would obviously be better. Home roasted only beats grocery on flavor"
1364,I overlooked it as too far into the deep end… but it’s amazing. I’d say it’s roughly equivalent from going from pre-ground to whole ground coffee.
1365,You can kind of emulate it at the store… but it’s really hard. For a while I was that obnoxious guy checking all the dates on the packaging to get the freshest one. Even if you’re willing to do this “best by” dates are more common than “roasted on”.
1366,I struggle to consistently get through a whole bag of coffee in 3 days. I like to mix up my origins and roasts each day. Green coffee stays fresh much longer and allows you to roast how much you need for the week.
1367,Coffee is still good after a week but there is something special about those first few days to one week. The bloom is so intense you can hear the filter paper displacing slightly. Sticking your nose in a bag too… there is a clear difference.
1368,Maybe it’s in my head but it be end coffee seems much more flavorful too.
1369,Am I delusional or are there other believers? Talk some sense into me before I drop a couple hundred on a fresh roast machine!
1370,"Whenever I'm seeing recipes for pour overs, a total brew time is always provided as a ""soft goal"". But one thing I've always wondered about is how people define what the ""total brew time"" is?"
1371,"For example, do you stop the timer when the majority of the water has gone through the bed (when you cant see water above the bed anymore), or when it has stopped dripping completely? The slow drip can add another minute or so to the total brew time if you count that."
1372,"Obviously this is kind of splitting hairs and TBT is (in my opinion) kind of useless beyond diagnosing bad brews, l, but Ive always wondered how people out there time their brews."
1373,"I found out no matter the origin or the farm, Geshas are more or less the same. Has anyone else found this to be true? If so, why is this the case?"

1385,"Just read this thread about overextraction and what it really means - quite eye-opening. But it got me questioning whether stalling/clogging v60 and consequently longer brew times actually lead to over-extracted cup, provided there was no channeling."
1386,Would that assumption be correct or am I missing something?
1387,"Additionally, I was of an opinion that the reason why v60 remains so popular despite a steeper learning curve is that it can give the cleanest, most flavourful cup with the right technique. But if it's so much easier to make the most out of the brew through a longer immersion with aeropress, how come v60 continues to be so popular?"
1388,"Is there a reason why some prefer a boiler machine over thermoblock? Isn’t the warmup time alone enough reason to choose a thermoblock machine every time? I’m sure I’m missing some nuances, but would love to hear a little perspective before taking the plunge!"
1389,So I've just recently started keeping a daily tasting journal of my brewing recipes. I use an Aeropress with James Hoffman's method.
1390,Currently brewing a fairly light roast natural process Mexican coffee from a local roaster.
1391,"After settling on 12g/200g water at 98C, I decided to scale up to 15/250 the next day. Interestingly, the cup had a very similar flavor profile, but was less acid forward. I'm thinking it might be due to the water that gets through the filter before I get the plunger on. With the larger brew, that under-steeped coffee is a smaller percentage of the final product."
1392,I was very surprised initially that just scaling up with the same ratio changed the taste.
1393,"I haven't tried the inverted method yet with these beans, but that's probably my next experiment. In the past, I've found that the inverted method produces a more reliable but less defined cup."
1394,I have a couple questions for everybody:
1395,Does this make sense? Is the first portion of a brew the most acidic?
1396,"If you use the inverted method, any tips for getting more clarity from your cup?"
1397,I'll be getting a V60 soon. Do you experience the same effect with recipe scaling on pourovers?
1398,"Edit: For clarification, I actually prefer the lower acidity, and will probably stick with the 250g brew as my go-to. I tried 100C with the 200g brew and found it to be too harsh, but might revisit with the 250g brew."
1399,"I'm always getting some sort of weird bitter coffee whenever I try James Hoffman's v60 method. When I heard about the aeropress being this simple yet delicious, it intrigued me to buy it. At the first brew with James Hoffman's aeropress method, I instantly knew that I suck at doing pour-over coffees as the aeropress brew has such a smooth body, rich flavor, and a right balance."
1400,"I was wondering what the hell I did wrong with my v60 pour over, lol"
1401,I am getting a bodum French Press and want to know how to best utilize getting the most out of my coffee.
1402,go with beans that I grind or get them grinned down already?
1403,"How to transfer the coffee. What cups work the best? Ceramic, glass, or metals?"
1404,Thanks in advance!
1405,"So I have a Comandante version 3 that I've been using for a while, however recently I have begun to wonder if there is a variance in number of clicks for a respective grind size from one Comandante to another."
1406,"The reason I ask is, I routinely see people talking about brewing at like 19 to 25 clicks for pourover( or lower) but no matter what my other parameters are, at that setting I will get a very unpleasant bitterness, and/or clogging and channelling.  I find I have to grind around 28 to 30 clicks to get a decent cup.  Doesn't matter the coffee, water parameter, temperature, brew time etc, I will never be able to brew a V60 with my Comandante at those lower grind settings.   Even at 26 I was getting unpleasant bitter notes and astringency on every coffee in my subscription pack last month.  Click 28 to 31: nice clear, bright cups."
1407,"My concern is twofold.  Perhaps there's a defect in my burr set that is causing a much wider particle distribution or excessive fines?  Or perhaps they aren't manufactured to very exacting tolerances, which is not very appealing."
1408,"I'm not exactly unhappy with my coffee, quite the contrary, but my OCD is plaguing my thoughts with ""it's not as good as it could be"" and I start seeing it to be very common to grind at a lower grind settings and it just fuels that fire even more so."
1409,Anyone else grind that high on one of these?  Or any suggestions to test if the burr is not sitting right?  It looks perfectly flush at the zero point. . I just don't know.
1410,Any thoughts?
1411,"I got a dirt-cheap Noon East ""15 bar"" espresso machine off a friend. Now i think I outgrew its capabilities/output- cannot determine its pump pressure and temp, weak pump (3-5 bar i guess). Any suggestions for a Learning Machine that is cheap, that has the capability to pull out high quality shots with effort? I got a JXPro hand grinder ATM... thank you"
1412,I’ll be away from home for about 2 months and I don’t want the water to sit there for so long.
1413,Can’t find anything online to point me in the right direction. I’m debating just tipping it over and shaking it lol
1414,Does anyone know how to completely drain the water tank and insides?
1415,"Having a moment where I think I might have been in an alternate dimension here: maybe three or four years back, I was able to buy a certain (now forgotten) brand of decaf coffee that was designed for nighttime consumption. As best I can remember, it was from a somewhat major brand (i.e. Dunkin, Lavazza, not a small roaster) and likely had a purple logo. It was a pretty decent and tasty cup of coffee, especially considering the whole decaf/night gimmick."
1416,"It was decaffeinated obviously and IIRC had another ingredient that was supposed to relax you or induce sleep, possibly chamomile. I was buying this in the Philadelphia metro area and actually only ever found it in one particular Acme grocery store. Searching Acme's website and the internet at large has yielded no results. Does anyone know what I am talking about? I greatly appreciate any leads!!"
1417,"Facebook memories have haunted me today by reminding me that 8 years ago today I got my first bag of Guatemalan beans from Pact coffee. Before then I knew I enjoyed a cup of coffee, but that's the moment I started down the rabbit hole we all live in. I've since had better coffees, but that first ""proper"" bag will always have a special place in my heart and my love of central American coffee remains as strong as ever."
1418,"Watching the coffee scene explode over the last few years has been fantastic, especially the growth of small independent roasters."
1419,"Can any of you pinpoint the moment you started down the coffee journey, or that cup that made you go ""this magic concoction is gonna be in my life forever""?"
1420,Freshly roasted beans - dry and hard vs oily and soft?
1421,Tried James Hoffman’s French press method but got super murky coffee.
1422,Switching recipe based on roast?
1423,"Wow. Just got an ""end-game"" hand grinder as a gift replacing my """"budget"""" (lol) electric burr grinder and I can actually taste subtleties in my coffee??"
1424,Adjusting inventory in QB for weight loss?
1425,Nitro coffee roayal brew
1426,What's a good way to taste good coffee?
1427,"Setup: 500g water to 30g dark roast beans, Comandante grinder, Aeropress"
1428,My daily driver is a locally roasted bean that is “oily and soft” by my definition. I like 3 of their varieties that are all “oily and soft”.
1429,"I’ve been given and tried quite a few beans from other roasters that I would qualify as “dry and hard”. Harder to grind, dry and staticy grounds."
1430,"Does it make sense that moisture content of the beans drives what I like or not, as long as it’s a dark roast?"
1431,"What is different in the bean or roasting process between the two that could result in oily and soft, but typically darker grounds, and dry and hard?"
1432,My hypotheses is that the dry ones may be roasted longer at a lower temperature.
1433,"Hi! I recently got off the plastic pods side of coffee, and today was my first time making a cup from actual beans. I followed James hoffman’s guide to making coffee with a French press pretty closely. I had medium roast while beans that were supposedly roasted recently, which I ground with the Hario Skerton Pro (manual burr grinder) to a medium coarseness (I just googled medium coarse coffee and tried to match my grind size to what I saw on google). James recommends 30 g coffee per 500 g water, so I did 15 grams for 250 grams of water. This seemed like a lot of grounds for 1 cup, but I pushed through. I followed the rest of his recipe pretty exactly, but my cup didn’t really look like his. In the video, his cup is significantly lighter and bright, while mine was super dark and fairly bitter. Any advice on what could have went wrong would be appreciated."
1434,"I generally drink medium roast coffee from a couple different specialty roasters in my area. I recently picked up a bag of honey processed, Abore from Ethiopia from roaster I’ve never tried before. It it was very underwhelming. It basically just tasted like coffee flavored water. It could be the brew method, could be the coffee, could be a bad roaster or it could be my unsophisticated palate."
1435,I brew with a Breville Grind Control and I generally get results that I’m really happy with. It’s kind of an infusion/drip hybrid brewer.
1436,"Do you brew or grind differently with a very light roast. If so, finer grind, more coffee, longer infusion?  It wasn’t cheap, so I’m trying to get better results without wasting too much more coffee."
1437,"I've been a coffee ""nerd"" for years, but never managed to get those coffees with fruity notes people were talking about. I've had an entry-level (by this sub's standards) electric burr grinder for going on 6 years now, and my aeropress coffee was (in my opinion) superior to most coffee places I visited, but I always felt like there was further it could go when compared to aeropress cups I'd ordered from nice places."
1438,For Christmas I was gifted a commonly-recommended grinder in this sub for around $120 and it is genuinely like night and day. It isn't as noticeable in darker roasts but my light roasts have taken on a whole new level of flavor they just did not have before. I have changed nothing else about the same recipe I have made for years besides the new grinder.
1439,Just starting home roasting business and want to know how you account for weight loss in Quick Books?
1440,I mean that you buy 10 lbs of beans  but end up with roughly 8.5 lbs to sell?
1441,"I've been making nitro coffee with one of the royal brew nitro kegs. Does anyone else prefer the taste of no2 vs straight n2? Especially with the price difference, your paying more then double using n2 vs no2."
1442,"I've really gotten into coffee at this point but I'm a little lost.  I use an aeropress for coffee and a flair neo with a bottomless attachment for espresso.  I've played with what different parameters (grinder size, brew time, brew temp, ect.) change with the flavor of the coffee as well as used different brew recipes, but I'm not sure if what I make is ""good"".  I definitely have found what I think is too bitter, but I struggle with acidity levels.  This being said, I would love to taste what is something everyone recognizes as ""good"" so I can compare.  Is it best to purchase specialty instant coffee or maybe go to a cafe and hope it's one that makes ""good coffee"" instead of the commodity??"
1443,Merry Christmas and Happy New Year. May your puck always come with one bang.
1444,"As silly/busy season draws to a close, the news is at its very quietest but there's some big stories this week nonetheless. I love feedback and comments - people have been so kind with their compliments and ideas and this is the reason I'm inspired to keep posting the update."
1445,Launch of an automatic latte art robot
1446,A machine which perfectly textures milk then pours consist latte art without a skilled barista? I don’t know man sounds like the robots are coming for our jobs.
1447,"This machine does not pour the art for you, but it does claim to 'perfectly texture' your milk first. I personally see these becoming popular at high end aesthetic cafes and with anyone competing in the latte art pouring championships."

1449,"Green coffee prices reverse course and begin to slip, including Brazil"
1450,"For this story, you’ll need to know a little about how futures work. It’s actually quite simple - the ‘strike price’ of coffee is how much it costs to buy green coffee today to be delivered today. The ‘3m future’ price is the price to have to have coffee delivered in three months (“3m’)."
1451,"While strike prices for are reasonably stable, the futures prices have slipped considerably - driven by good weather all over the world and in particular in Brazil where there have been concerns. All good news for the consumer in March and April 23."

1454,Pret orders new machines to keep up with subscription orders
1455,The Pret coffee subscription (£25 a month for all-you-can-drink) has been a huge success. This innovation has led to an increase in their overall drink flow and and so the food chain is moving to increasingly automated machines from Cimbali to keep up with the demand.

1467,Has coffee become more popular lately?
1468,Pretty much the title.
1469,I've been solely making pour overs every morning for the past couple of years and I'm starting to wonder if the recipe itself really matters that much.
1470,"I've been to tons of great cafes and roasteries and of course, made my own at home, and have had pour overs ranging from mind-blowing to meh. The thing that I've noticed among the mind-blowing cups is there's so many different recipes used. I've seen recipes call for bloom/no bloom, agitation after bloom/no agitation after bloom, and single pours/multi-pours. All recipes I've noted have a mix-match of these variables."
1471,"I just upgraded my grinder at home from the Baratza Encore to the 1zpresso K-Plus and as I continue on my pour over adventure I'm really starting to wonder if recipe matters all that much. It might make more sense for me to start playing with other variables such as water temperature, grind size, grounds to water ratio, etc. and sticking with a singular recipe."
1472,Let me know your guys thoughts and experience on this as I'm sure I still have a ton to learn.
1473,I’ve tried a few times now and can’t get it. I do think each time I try it gets less and less bitter but still not to my liking.
1474,"I do the James Hoffman way. 15g —>250g ration. Wet the paper. 50g to bloom, gentle swirl then 50g of water each to get to roughly 3 mins brew."
1475,Using a light fresh coffee and did medium/fine ground with 205 water. I do admit I have a “cheap” grinder. Maybe that’s it.
1476,Not sure what I’m doing wrong. Any ideas?
1477,"Ok so hear me out, I know people infuse coffee beans in whiskey. Does anyone have a recipe for this? Also if I dry the beans after I infuse them with the whiskey, can I use them to make coffee?"
1478,"See title. I’ve never been a coffee drinker and a relative newbie. I’m more of a tea fan, and I have some medical things that limit my caffeine intake. My wife however absolutely lives and dies by her morning coffee. A few months ago the nice coffee maker I got her kicked the bucket - partially due to our hard water. Being an early riser - and not wanting to spend $ for her to get an expensive but unsatisfying coffee maker - made I’ve been making her pour over with an old ChemEx every morning with her favorite local hazelnut roaster (she loves the blend)"

1480,"My method is as follows: 44g medium grind, 150 mL, 45 sec, 250 mL, 90 sec, 350 mL, drip till done."
1481,It is my way of sharing in love with her as she grumpily wakes up every morning.
1482,"I’d love to find some ways to surprise and delight my wife in the morning. Any suggestions for relatively cheap roasts, techniques? I’d love to buy a nice grinder eventually, but it’s not in the budget right now. Any suggestions? I’m open to whatever."
1483,Thank you!!!
1484,"My wife loves cold brew coffee and typically makes about a pitcher worth every weekend. This amount typically carries her through the week, sometimes there's a bit extra for me at then end :)"
1485,"Well, I travel regularly for work and try to prepare meals before leaving as to make the time alone a bit easier (we have two kids, she works full-time, and life is busy). This time, along with food prep, I made a large batch of cold brew concentrate and put it in Grolsch bottles for her - idea is that she can take a bottle to work and leave it in the fridge as a supply for a couple of days."
1486,"This got me thinking... Can I make a large batch and store it in a cool dry place for extended time? We have a root cellar which is underutilized, maybe I can fill ~20 of these bottles and we would have stock. Would the coffee keep that long? Fresh beans have a shelf life, does the brewed drink? What is that life? Maybe there's a better way to store it?"
1487,"I've got myself a nicer hand grinder and a shit electric grinder for coffee. I don't mind using the hand grinder a couple times a week, but it gets annoying on days  where I'm doing multiple rounds of coffee."
1488,"Coincidentally, for christmas, I got a bag of ground coffee. I've been using that so it won't go stale, and the difference isn't as bad as I thought it'd be. There isn't nearly as much residue left in my mocha machine compared to either home grind method and it's faster/more convenient."
1489,"Then again, my sense of smell fluctuates due to some medical issues, so, I figured I'd ask people who aren't smell-disabled for when mine gets back on track. What's your preference? A pre-ground with a decent grinder or a recently ground with a shit grinder?"
1490,I saw articles like this: https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/lula-eyes-green-farm-loans-tackle-amazon-deforestation-2022-08-17/
1491,"I am just wondering if Lula is successful and the Brazilian coffee farms and coffee production improve, depressing the global price again?"
1492,Correct if I am wrong but isn't one of the reasons that coffee producers struggle with low coffee bean prices/high production costs due to Brazil producing too much?
1493,"I am just wondering what the possible consequences are for the global coffee industry, especially for other coffee producing nations and farms."
1494,So I'm mainly a hario switch brewer with the occasional French press (if we have company and need to brew beyond two for me and my wife) or aeroprese (mainly for a single cup for me in the office).
1495,"But lately I've been somewhat espresso-curious, mainly because the Hoff and that Lance dude make it sound like espresso is so goddamn delicious."
1496,"My fear (other than the anxiety about dialing shots and obsessing over them ) is if dip my toe, will it make my other equipment obsolete? Is it like filter is your daily driver and you just spend weekends mornings dialling in Espresso shots? Or whatever strikes your fancy that day?"
1497,The wife is a sugar plus cream/milk kinda gal that might appreciate the possibility of at home iced flat whites/lattes but ha only complained that I'm not brewing right now.
1498,Obviously it'll be up to me but I'd like to hear some insight to the more advanced members of the sub how they go about the hobby
1499,"My wife got me the Baratza Encore for Christmas, so I followed James Hoffmann's video on setting up a coffee cupping to try and develop tasting skills. I picked up two bags each from two specialty roasters near me, in addition to a grocery store brand. I'm fairly certain everything here is a medium-light to medium roast. Everything was ground to what I think is a pretty neutral medium (#18 on Baratza Encore.)"
1500,"My scale only has 1g precision, so I tried to add only 9g of ground beans to each cup. Then brewed with 150ml of boiling water for 4 mins before stirring to stop the brewing."
1501,photo
1502,The 5 beans I used were (from left to right):
1503,Aldi Simply Nature Organic Honduras
1504,Ethiopian Yirgacheffe
1505,Guatemala Antigua
1506,Costa Rican patio dried
1507,Ethiopian Sidamo natural processed
1508,I'm such an amateur at this that unfortunately I really don't have any great tasting notes to describe. Overall I found it easiest to differentiate between the body and acidity than I did flavor.
1509,"The Guatemalan seemed to have a lot less body, which comparatively felt like I was drinking tea. Most of the others were pretty similar."
1510,"There were some minor differences in acidity between them, but nothing I could really consistently call out. The Aldi brand coffee did taste slightly less... intense? complex?... which I guess I attribute to it being by far the least freshly roasted. I was satisfied at being as to tell that difference."
1511,I was a little disappointed that I felt like I was getting floral notes in all of them. I was kind of hoping to get a chocolate or nut like flavor in some versus others. Maybe I need to try different roast levels in order to work myself towards being able to tell those differences.
1512,"Overall it was a fun experience and I'm glad I tried it. If anything it showed me how easy it was to set up, and hopefully in the future I'll be able to taste more diversity between each cup."
1513,"More specifically, Specialty Coffee, or well, anything more than your typical instant or pre-ground with a drip machine."
1514,"I've been drinking coffee for 10+ years, my whole adult life, but pretty much only pre-ground with a drip machine, the standard way in my country. The most exotic setup I had was a french press. Couple of years ago my wife bought a food processor with an included blade grinder unit and I tried it a couple of times, but it was a hassle so I didn't really stick with it."
1515,"Then, about a month ago, YouTube recommended me Wired's Coffee Support with James Hoffman, and I fell down the rabbit hole. fast forward a month, and I bought myself a Wilfa grinder, an AeroPress and some decent beans (not specialty yet), and I made the best cup of coffee I've ever made at home."
1516,"The thing is, I hadn't searched anything coffee related in a long time, yet I was recommended the video. I don't believe it was a coincidence. That (along with the fact Wired made an episode about coffee) makes me think there's a bigger trend going on, or about to come."
1517,"I'd like to hear from the community veterans, or even industry professionals. Have newcomers like myself started pouring in (no pun intended) recently? Or perhaps there has been a steady growth over a longer period of time? Any ideas what could have caused it? Any other interesting trends/changes you have noticed? I would also like to hear the stories of other newcomers."
1518,Thanks and have a great day!
