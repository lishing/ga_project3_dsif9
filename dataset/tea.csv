24,"I do like smoked foods but this was too much. It tastes like I'm munching on charred wood. I thought adding brown sugar might work, like a BBQ kinda thing I guess. Didn't work, still way too smoky. I don't want to just throw it out but if I can't enjoy it I think I will. I'd love to hear any ideas for how to cut the smokiness. This is looseleaf tea if that matters."
25,"I‚Äôve noticed that several recommended vendors don‚Äôt list the cultivar for some or all of their teas, just the region in which they were grown. Do you solely purchase teas if you know the cultivar, or do you think it‚Äôs unimportant?"
26,"Got a new one a couple months ago and after daily usage / being wet for hours a day, it‚Äôs visibly aging a lot faster than I would have imagined."
27,Do any of you have high-usage trays that have lasted a long time? Or are trays basically a consumable and should be replaced every couple years?
28,So I bought a electric tea kettle and it just came in today. I put water in it and hit the button for oolong to test it out which the kettles instruction manual said that‚Äôs 195 f so It heated up and it has an electronic thermometer on the side and it shut off when it hit 195 but continued to climb to 208. One does this happen with all electric tea kettles? Two how do I prevent this? I was thinking just Brew it at a lower temp and let it rise to the desired temp. But I‚Äôve also heard that the temperature drops when you pour it into a cup so is that accurate?
29,"From what I understand, ‚Äútrue‚Äù da hong pao is nearly impossible to find. What confuses me is that, according to Mei leaf, big red robe is the highest quality DHP and comes from the Qi Dan cultivar. However, Camellia Sinensis has a Big Red Robe DHP, but they list several different cultivars blended for the tea, none of which is Qi Dan. And then, in other blends, I‚Äôve seen cultivar names such as rou gui, qi lan, shui xian, Jin mu dan, and beidou. I‚Äôve even seen some of those cultivars listed by themselves without the name DHP attached to it at all. So what exactly is DHP? Are there really that many cultivars than can be called Da Hong Pao, and is it considered lower quality if they‚Äôre all blended together?"
30,"Several years ago I bought some black tea from a local coffee and tea store, they just labelled it as Kenyan tea vs a specific variety name, or a specific estate."
31,"It was excellent tea, the strongest tea I've ever had, the closest tea that I've had that compared to coffee. A cup of that really would wake you up"
32,"Sadly they stopped carrying it, I asked but they didn‚Äôt know the name of the type of Kenyan tea or estate it was from, or where I could get it."
33,Most of the Kenyan tea I've seen since then is broken leaf version of Kenyan tea.
34,"Vs the small round pellet size of the Kenyan tea that I liked, it was similar to look of Irish Breakfast tea, but even stronger than Irish Breakfast tea (which is the strongest non Kenyan tea I‚Äôve tasted)."
35,I don't even know what name to look for.
36,"Does anyone know what would the the name, or names of Kenyan Black tea that is a small round pellet shaped version and very strong, vs loose leaf or broken leaf version of tea?"

38,"I want to add bergamot to my tea for that sweet citrus flavoring, but I can't figure out the difference between all the different types of bergamot out there."
39,"They have the dry fruit peel extracts, the bergamot essential oils, and the 100% pure bergamot oil which appears to be food grade except the label suggests is still from essential oil? And so it's basically like food grade essential oil, but what exactly makes it food grade? It's still an essential oil lol??"

Or some such other brand i've seen at Target."

100,"I am volunteering to help run a Renn Faire at my son's school. It's an elementary school, and basically there are a bunch of booths with a lot of activities for the kids to do."
101,"I had the idea that along side the potpourri booth, there could be a ""tea making"" booth."
102,And then I was asked to run the booth.
103,"I drink a lot of tea, but I have no clue how I would go about doing it."
104,"So, I'm asking for some help from all of you."
105,What do you think might be the best way to host such a tea making booth for about 900 kids?
106,"First, the tea must not be caffeinated."
107,"Secondly, I was thinking of making tea bags that the kids could fill and take away with them to use at home. Would that be a good idea?"
108,"Thirdly, what ingredients should I have available?"
109,"I was thinking that the students could choose 2 or 3 ingredients from several, maybe with some helpful recipes if they can't decide. What would you recommend that is easy to buy in bulk (and cheap!), easy to prepare, and not too messy?"
110,Is there anything I'm not thinking of?
111,Thank you!
112,"Excuse my ignorance, I have these tea and I'm not sure what they are, I'm just an amateur in the matter."
113,"1 - According to the package this is Orange Pekoe, some kind of Black Tea... ¬øIs this correct?2 - ¬øIs this Black Tea? the packaged labeled it as ""classic tea"" or something like that.3 - This was a gift from my Chinese teacher. He said it was Jasmine Tea and that they also call it Flower Tea, and it certainly smells like it. At first I thought that it might be some kind of Jasmine infusion, but when I looked at it, the leaves looked like what I know to be White Tea, and when I tried it, it seemed to me that it had the same color and soft taste of White Tea. After some internet research I found out that it is White Tea with Jasmine... ¬øHave you heard about it?4 - This is Green Tea but I don't know what type."
114,Thanks in advance!
115,"Hi r/tea!I just got into the habit of binging making jasmine milk tea and I've been wondering on how to strenghten the taste of jasmine. I've looked online and in order to minimise the bitterness from the tannings I found these instructions: 4g per 200ml, 85c for  3 minutes. This leaves me with a very floral tea with very little bitterness. But I want to taste it more. I know at my local bubble tea shop they can make a stronger jasmine milk tea."
116,Now what should I do in order to maximise the jasmine tea without making it too bitter? Is there a limit to the amount of leaves I can put in? Whats the minimum heat I need to put in to get the catechins?
117,Thanks ahead of time.

So I have a buildup of calcium on the bottom of the tea kettle and I'm looking for an easy way to clean it without harming the kettle itself, due to large hands I cannot get Intuit with a rag to scrub it out so I'm hoping there's some sort of soap that I could just pour in let it run and clean it that way. I lost my other electric kettle to the same issue, which is why I switched over to only doing filtered water"

249,I loved this tea and I was wondering if anyone had made a replica or has a recipe blend for it. I would really like to try and replicate it myself but its been a long time since I had it.
250,"The more tea I brew gongfu style, the more cumbersome my coffee mug and fork system seems. I was curious if there's any sources people like beyond Etsy. Searching back through the sub, I really only found that people don't recommend Tezumi, but not much else."
251,"Edit: it occurred to me that it might help if I added what I'm ideally looking for. Id prefer something artist-made. Etsy was largely filled with factory-made ceramics. Love wood and soda firings, not generally huge on painted decoration, but I'm open to any leads."
252,I would appreciate any advice from folks with experience brewing minis from white2tea!
253,"I received my order of white2tea minis over the weekend and decided to start with the 2022 blood moon mini today. I was excited about this tea, but unfortunately was not able to brew a satisfactory cup. I started with my 150 ml gaiwan and 190F water. After a quick rinse, the mini was still tightly compressed. I then tried a 20 second rinse followed by a 30 second infusion, but the ball barely loosened. I decided to switch to grandpa style at that point, which I admittedly do not have much experience with. I threw the ball in a coffee mug with 190F water. It took about 30 minutes for the mini ball to unfurl. I took sips periodically during this time and found that it just sort of went from pretty flavorless to bitter."
254,"I foolishly only purchased one of each type of mini that white2tea offers, so I don't have room to experiment with different brewing parameters for the same tea. Any tips for the next mini that I try? Should I break apart the ball myself, rather than relying on the water? Steam the ball to loosen it up before infusing? Did I try the tea too soon after shipment, resulting in an underwhelming flavor? I am letting the puers rest a few weeks, but I haven't seen the same advice for white or black teas."

290,where are some good places in the philippines (physically or online) to buy good-quality tea (preferably loose-leaf)?
291,thank you!
292,Hello
293,Which teas do not have a diuretic effect? I often have to urinate because of endometriosis. THANKS!
294,"I just started my loose-leaf tea adventure and I am loving it, I started out with a subscription box from BRUU. it is so cheap and gives me different teas every month to try and information about where the tea is from in the box. My personal faves currently are Biscottea and Choccy Chai but most of them are fantastic. What is everyones opinion on BRUU if you have tried them?"
295,"I love black/green tea and various herbal teas and ideally would like to swap a morning coffee for tea, however on early rising in the morning tea makes me feel nauseous due to empty stomach so a coffee is fine for me on a empty stomach of course I could eat breakfast then a cup of tea but coffee has that kick to get my day started besides I like to wait an hour before eating breakfast"
296,"Even through the day I need a small snack with the tea to prevent nausea probably its the tannins in the tea but I know plenty of people that can drink tea on a empty stomach, I can drink herbal tea on a empty stomach but sometimes you need the caffeine of black/green tea"
297,"Overall impression: 9/10 tea. Price per session 14usd. Best example for water fragrance I have ever had, this really brings out the floral notes in the tea and allowed the maker to explore more toasty notes that I normally associate with poor quality dancongs that were over roasted. This tea shows the skill of the craftsperson who made it."
298,"First brew had a distinct water fragrance which continues lasts astonishingly long through the brews. A building sweetness in the back of throat that I would compare to a banana, lasts ~10 minutes. After the third brew there is a cinnamon flavor that starts to develop."
299,"Brew 5 starts to remind me of a nice lightly roasted coffee, very floral with smaller notes of caramel and chocolate."
300,At brew 10 the flavors become more muddled. I still get notes of coffee but they are hard to distinguish from the chocolate. The floral flavors are starting to dim as well. Overall tea was flavorful but at this point i would compliment it with a tea snack that is low in fat content.
301,I just ordered Japanese sencha and very berry matcha from Harvey and sons. Has anybody had these I would love to hear a review if you have.
302,"Edit: Relaxation, focus, clarity, sense of peace, nostalgia, - this feeling is what I'm looking for! btw thanks guys for the recommendations too!"
303,I saw this in the FAQ here
304,"""Loose leaf does not always mean whole leaf. Good quality loose leaf teas will usually be the entire leaf. If it looks shredded or torn apart, your tea may not be very high quality."""
305,"I‚Äôve been getting Adagio teas because it‚Äôs one of many recommended by the sub, but their teas do seem torn up.   They also add artificial flavors‚Äîdo those mean the quality at Adagio aren‚Äôt actually that good?"
306,"Just looking for solid quality tea and learning what that looks like, thanks"
307,"I lurk here and see a lot of people mentioning Adagio isn't the best of quality but is good for starting out and trying things (I do agree). That's mainly where I've ordered tea in the past.Now I'm trying to look for better quality teas, but in all honesty, I'm a broke college student who balks at some of the premium prices out there. I'm sure some are well worth the cost, but it's not something I'm in the position to afford the splurge for. I do treat myself to a sampler pack from Eco-cha once a year, but again it's only a sample pack.What other businesses/sites should I look at for better quality teas that won't kill my budget? I'm not picky about the varieties I like, enjoying just about any main category of tea types. I like to alternate what I have. I don't particularly care for hibiscus though."
308,Wou√∂d that add any flavour? I really like cocoa nibs and thought it might be nice
309,"Trader Joe's used to have a tea sampler (A Taste of Ten Teas). One of those teas is licorice root and ginger white tea and it's phenomenal and I've been trying so hard to recreate it. I had a little success  but the ingredients were hard to find locally, couldn't buy any of them in any kind of quantity, and what little I did get was expensive for the amount I got.. so I've been hoarding the last bit of it. On a whim, I ordered the closest equivalent I could find from Monterey Bay Herb Co - white tea, cut ginger, and cut licorice root. But I can't seem to get it right this time around. My tea ends up bitter after a few minutes and loses all of it's sweetness from the licorice."

333,I been spending a lot more time on this Reddit community lately and I‚Äôm really enjoying it! I previously spent a lot of my time on facebook‚Äôs gongfucha group as that‚Äôs the most active tea-enthusiast group on Facebook but I haven‚Äôt been much active using Facebook lately. I notice some similarities and differences between the vibes on the two platforms. Love to hear what people have to say about the gfc group on Facebook if you‚Äôre on there too!
334,"Very fond of Emperor's Clouds and Mist from Starbucks. I know I like that, otherwise I'm pretty GREEN (get it?) when it comes to explaining what I like in a tea. Any tips on what to look for to find something similar, as I'm looking to branch out a tiny bit, but would love a loose leaf tea instead of bags. If it helps, I'm in Canada if you have a favourite online tea shop or something."
335,"Is there such thing as a kyusu style teapot fit for 1 person (200-250ml) with a thermal interior to maintain temperature for a longer time, or is this considered heresy in the tea drinking world? When my favorite little teapot broke last month I used a small thermos with a mesh to brew my tea while waiting for a replacement, and it worked very nicely, but now that my replacement has arrived I am kind of missing the thermoses effectiveness for keeping the brew warm."
336,"Also I'd be interested in knowing how to go about finding a fine mesh for certain teapots as I have another slightly bigger pot that simply cannot brew without an infuser or the stem/spout will get clogged (the biggest infuser I have is the size of an egg which still doesn't allow enough room for some leaves to brew) It did come with a mesh, but as is common with teapots it didn't go all the way to the bottom, nor did it leave enough room for the leaves to properly infuse."
337,"I usually purchase ginger tear with honey that come in a box of 20. If you're not familiar with this tea, picture tiny little yellow beads, aprox one third of a pea. The little beads in a pack melt instantly in hot water."

341,"David's Tea unfortunately shut down it's locations where I live and this tea used to be my absolute FAVORITE, and it's pretty much out of stock everywhere online. Has anyone tried this tea or know of a tea that tastes similar?"
342,The Ingredients are -
343,""" Apple  (apple, citric acid), Pineapple (pineapple, sugar), Hibiscus blossoms,  White tea, Sprinkles (sugar, rice flour, cocoa butter, thickener  tragacanth, beetroot juice  concentrate), Natural (strawberry, passion fruit) flavouring, Carrot,  Orange peel, Lemongrass, Strawberries, Passion fruit (apple puree  concentrate, ascorbic acid, passion fruit concentrate), Marigold  blossoms."""
344,"I just got my loose leaf teas today(I bought milk oolong, chamomile, and Earl grey). I tried the Earl grey and I'm not really sure if I got the tea to taste right. My first few sip was pretty bland but when I tried to put milk on it, it tasted just like those boba milk tea without the obvious sweetness."
345,"In my second cup, I put more tea leaves. First few sip was still pretty bland but when the tea cooled down a little, there was a slight bitterness and floral(I don't know what to call it but as I sip the aroma just goes through my nose even though I'm not breathing)."
346,I still think it's pretty bland but that's probably because I'm more used to very sweet instant coffees. Just like how fresh milk tasted really bland before I finally got to notice the taste the more I drink it.
347,I never tried the tea bags so I'm a complete beginner to teas. So did I make a decent tea or nah?
348,"I ordered a sampler box of some dancongs that are not charcoal roasted, I‚Äôm told they were instead baked in a wood oven."
349,I‚Äôve tried 2 out of 4 so far and have noticed some pretty stark differences from other dancongs I‚Äôve had.
350,"First, they don‚Äôt really get bitter. When I overdrew these they‚Äôre mostly just astringent, where other dancongs I‚Äôve had get unbearably bitter."
351,"Second, they seem to taste a bit flat and very samey. I‚Äôll have to try all of them to be sure, but I‚Äôve only noticed veeeery slight differences in taste and they feel a bit weak for dancong."
352,"I‚Äôve tried both flash steeping and steeping normally, I just can‚Äôt seem to bring out the rich flavors I‚Äôve come to expect from dancong. Is this because they‚Äôre unroasted or because I‚Äôm doing something wrong?"

Think $8-20 per 100g vs $20-40+ per 25g.

391,"I had a pivotal experience recently with some YS yancha (AA DHP). I hated  it about 2 months ago when it brewed up with overpowering notes of cannabis, tobacco, and ash. Some fresh air and rest...and it's basically everything I ever wanted out of a tea - particularly the right blend of smoke (i.e. ""Montana hipster smoking his trout catch"" rather than ""Boomer dad's ash tray""), baked & spiced fruit (aroma, on the palette, and pleasant aftertaste), and a terroir reminiscent of a highly mineral white burgundy.

I have been microwaving the water to just under boiling for some oolong. But I just asked for black tea recommendations here and have two kinds to try on the way from yunnan sourcing that are whole leaf. I am afraid that the infuser in this adagio cup I have is too small to make the most of this new tea."
435,"Now, I like the 12 oz size. It is perfect for my daily tea time on my lunch break. And I like the quickness of microwaving the mug of water so I can fit it in my lunch time. How do I manage the same time window for brewing the tea and also allowing for more space for the whole leaves? Gong fu brewing seems like less space than the 12 oz I am used to but I could be wrong. Open to a reasonably priced electric kettle. Is there something obvious I am missing?"

But all the metal strainers will sink and I can't fit my hand in nor is a spoon long enough. Is there a strainer anyone can recommend? Or maybe one with a really long chain so I can at least keep it on with the lid while it steeps? I mostly only like fruit teas and I steep them longer than called for because I like the stronger taste (they're pretty subtle to begin with).

458,"I very recently had an incredible tea session with friends that went on for 3 hours! We did some rock oolong tasting, then had some incredible aged sheng, and then had hei-cha to wind us down from the pu'erh. This experience felt so incredible, just being present, laughing with friends and discussing the simplicities of life. After having probably the best tea session I've ever had it made me wonder what are some of other peoples best, and most profound tea moments!"
459,"So tea community of reddit, what is the most profound moment you have had over tea?"
460,"I bought an yixing teapot about 6 months ago. I'm not an expert on yixing teapots, so to be honest I'm not really sure what I've got. The color is somewhere between red clay and purple clay, so I think it's Hongni, but I'm not sure. For most of the time I've owned this teapot, I've been using a darker-roasted dong ding oolong."
461,"Today, I tried a lighter dong ding tea in it. Just as an experiment, I brewed the same tea in a tiny porcelain gaiwan I have. The two teas came out completely different. The flavors were mostly the same, but the tea that came out of the yixing pot had a much thicker mouthfeel and the color was significantly darker.I was surprised at how different the same tea was."
462,Is it normal for the effect of yixing to be this strong?
463,"Is this the result of the more even temperature of the clay vs porcelain, the properties of the clay itself, or the effect of brewing a darker dong ding tea in the teapot in the past?"
464,TLDR: Is it normal for tea from an yixing teapot to be thicker and darker than tea from porcelain?
465,"Hey everyone :) I made a post the other day about always hating tea but wanting to start liking it lol. Anyways, I really want to try loose leaf! I‚Äôm hoping to just get a cheap, simple strainer/infuser or whatever they‚Äôre called, and some sample teas."
466,"I‚Äôve been looking at some cheap fine mesh infusers on Amazon and would love to get some recommendations from you all. Under $10 would be awesome! I‚Äôve also been browsing Adagio as I heard about them on TikTok and noticed they have an option for samples on their teas, so that seems perfect."

Is there a certain type that‚Äôs good to start with?

488,I would love some direction if possible.
489,I just learned I could be doing this but really don't know what my general guidelines should be. I drink mostly English breakfast and then various forms of fruit teas depending on what I feel like that day. I really don't even know where to begin and didn't see anything in the FAQ about this question specifically
490,"To be more specific, I'm looking for tea that smells like tobacco leaves and not the smoke. I enjoy the smell of tobacco leaves and that first aroma when a cigarette is lit but not the smoke itself. The closest I've come to finding such tea was a shou puerh that was made with large leaves. The trouble is I don't remember what that tea was and now I'm looking to find something similar to the way it tasted. Thanks in advance."

503,"I really want to get into matcha and understand that it needs to be brewed to a specific temperature. Because of this, I was looking into getting a variable temperate kettle. At some point during my research, I've seen comments to just ""get a Zojirushi"". However, the ""top of the line"" model that I see recommended is very expensive. I do have some spending money that's accumulated over the past couple of months but I'm still not sure if it's worth the investment or if I should settle for a variable temperature kettle, especially since I'm a single guy so it's not like multiple people are going to be using it. I do drink tea throughout the day/evening though so it seems handy to have hot water on demand."

534,"I've tried to research it but can't seem to find the info. I'm curious if there's a general rule of thumb for when certain things, the antioxidants, minerals, caffeine, get extracted during infusion. I always thought that HIGHER temps tend to pull out more caffeine and super lower temps for tea like gyokuro pull out the L-Theanine first. And is there any difference between the early and later infusions if they are all done at the same temperature?"
535,"Here is a noob question: can you make iced tea with any herbal tea? Some ideas I have in mind are rooibos, Lady Gray, peppermint, etc. By iced tea I mean brew it, let it cool, pour it in a pitcher, stick it in the fridge. The ice tea will be plain/straight, no additives (no sugar, lemon, etc.). If it is possible to make iced tea with any herbal tea, how long would it last in the fridge? Is this different than black tea in any regard? Thanks!"
536,"I‚Äôm looking for recommendations for specific teas or tea types that you find suited for straight up thermos brew. By this I mean just throwing some leaves in a thermos(16oz) hot water, and drinking it all the way down through out the day or next few hours."
537,"For me I‚Äôve found that shou is the most reliable in this style, but have really been enjoying some dark teas like Lui bao and Fu brick stuff in this way. I have also had some good luck with a few greens and whites but it really seems hit or miss with those."
538,As far as teas that I haven‚Äôt figured out how to brew this way would be sheng puer and black teas. Sheng just goes too bitter/sour and black goes overly tanniny.
539,Anyway just curious if anyone else tends to drink tea this way and has suggestions on how to improve or what specific teas have worked for you.

As we sit in the same building which reddit is, i would like to knock knock to your subreddit and ask if there are tea geeks in the tea World too? I wonder what is the most geeky thing in your opinion when it comes to tea brewing. Do people import fresh water from different places for example? Measure humidity and pH level of their leaves? Is there any trend that is promoted by social media and people are crazy about it? For example, many bread bakers want to achive an 'open crumb' and try to bake most hydrated bread they can what (water to flour ratio)in fact is not the thing that determinated the good or great bread."

552,I hope I have not unwittingly raised a controversial issue on this esteemed sub.
553,know they are two very different flavours but that's kinda my profile for tea is darjeeling with soy milk and a few sweeteners and Assam black with nothing but some honey. I enjoy Chai aswell.
554,"I don't enjoy flavoured or herbal teas very often, the I mildly enjoy some oolong on a a cold night."
555,Any suggestions? I bulk buy Taylors loose tea and Birchall sometimes as a daily staple tea.
556,"So I got started with Verdant Tea because they had a 5 samples for $5 (with a $5 coupon so it comes out free assuming you want to buy more after) deal, just 5 grams per sample so I could do one gongfu session with each. I'm shopping pretty much exclusively online, since there aren't many tea shops in my area that are anything like the craft tea online. The only one I know of is closed for a move. So I'm now running into a problem trying to expand where I'm shopping beyond the first place I tried."
557,"Lots of places have expensive samplers for $40-50+, but do you all know of vendors who have an inexpensive way to try their tea before fully committing, similar to the deal I found above? Trying not to risk tons of money on unknown quantities in my brand new hobby."

573,Again thank you all.
574,So after looking through previous posts I was not able to find what I was looking for. So hoping this post will be more of a use for that.

576,"I like a good breakfast tea with Assam, African, Chinese, or other Indian teas. Now it doesn't need to be all of those together but a nice blend with some would be great."
577,"I like a good full-bodied, strong, and slightly malty tea that I can do milk and sugar in. Preferably loose leaf would be nice."
578,"Now I know that Assam will be best for the maltiness but 100% Assam is far too malty for me. So if anyone has any suggestions for any breakfast blends with these characteristics, any help will be greatly appreciated"

I'm kinda at the point where I really want to explore the different variations of these teas and am also interested in the sorta meditation side to this style as well. It seems like you need to find quality teas that hold multiple steeping ability and have read some things about the quality of a gaiwan  contributing to the tea brewing as well.

653,Okay I just joined to ask this very question üòÇ I‚Äôve gotten myself into the tea world (a little) and I love to sit down right when I get to work and drink some tea. I have an hour long commute in the mornings. And I‚Äôm looking for a really nice travel mug that feels and tastes like I‚Äôm sipping from a mug- but that will keep the heat longer than 20 minutes. I‚Äôve come across ceramic coated cups but the reviews say they chip or stain easy. And there‚Äôs a really pretty one from W&P that really interests me but it‚Äôs $40 and I don‚Äôt want to spend that much unless it‚Äôs quality! Please help lol
654,I love chamomile tea and have been drinking Traditional Medicinals' brand for years. But I'm just now noticing something odd about the instructions on the box and packets when it comes to brewing sizes.
655,It says pour 8 oz freshly boiled water over 2 tea bags.
656,2 tea bags for 8 oz of water? Is this a typo? Says same thing on both box and each packet.
657,I have four other teas by this same brand and they all say 1 tea bag for 8 oz water.
658,"I don't think chamomile is weak enough to warrant 2 bags. Heck, I always use extra water, with the 1 bag, and it is plenty strong and tasty enough."
659,This is specifically for their chamomile and lavender tea. I'll have to check later for their plain chamomile tea.
660,Do other brands recommend this same method as well? I'd really like to know because I started drinking this tea for its health benefits. If I'm not getting enough of them from just 1 bag per serving I'd like to know.
661,Hey community!
662,Looking for advice in searching of any information about teapot.
663,I only have now is stamp mark on a bottom of a teapot:
664,I think that this is a silver (or bronze with silver coating) chinese traditional teapot. I don't have any other information at the moment. Maybe someone can recognize this stamp?
665,"I'm new to tea and decided to try a random black tea first. Celestial Seasonings English Breakfast Black Tea, if it matters."
666,"I put the tea bag in a mug, added boiling water, and let it steep for 4 minutes (the package said 3-5 minutes). After it cooled down a bit, I took a sip and.... it just tasted like hot water. The color was dark like coffee so there's obviously tea in it, but no flavor."
667,I tried again with steeping for 6 minutes. Barely any effect. Same dark color.
668,Am I messing up somewhere?
669,"Want some earthy evening blends! Currently drinking tons of rooibos, chamomile, and lavender but would love to change things up :)"

It‚Äôs been too long to pull up an old order receipt and I can‚Äôt remember the store or name of the tea! Would like to mention that I‚Äôm no tea expert, just a casual enjoyer of tea without the critical eye/tastebuds of many here so sorry if I sound brutish‚Ä¶"
672,"The tea was a green tea of some type, loose leaf but in little round pearls with what appeared to be yellow/white strands/swirls mixed in with the green. The dry tea smelled very strongly like buttery caramel. My understanding is this tea did not have any artificial flavoring added. This is the way it naturally smelled. The pearls would unravel into dark green leaves in the tea and resulted in a VERY buttery flavor. The most delicious buttery tea I‚Äôve ever had!"

700,"Wegmans (Grocery Store) and Teas's Tea (sold from Amazon.com, probably available nationwide)"
701,"I've only known about Teas' Tea from when I lived in Seattle (imported no doubt). Five years after moving to Baltimore, I discovered Wegmans store brand. I don't have them together to taste but my brain says the taste is indistinguishable."
702,"What made me all curious to research this is that Wegmans states ""Product of Japan"" on the bottle. What I remember from various Asian markets in Seattle was that bottled tea typically had a white sticker with nutrition information, typical of imported food and beverages. So I gather that Wegmans is bottled in Japan for export to the USA. Rather than an American importer bringing over product and conforming it for sale in the USA. Think of bottled ""Mexican Coke"". The beautiful bottles have that ""annoying to remove nutrition information label""."
703,"As for Teas' Tea, I spent time reading through the comments and questions on its Amazon.com product page. There's a lot of debate on the origins of the product: Japan, Taiwan, Korea. It seems to now be bottled in Taiwan for American import. Or maybe it's sourced from multiple countries based on economics or a whim from the brand."
704,"Does any of this matter? *Shrug* I will stock up on 4 cases of Wegmans. As a store brand, they could easily change their source. Oh yeah, now I remember...does anyone know of any other brands of bottled green tea (unsweetened) that would be easily accessible from within the US?"

734,I‚Äôve been on a green tea kick lately. Been getting it everywhere but not too aware of the best brands. What are the best green teas out there that I should definitely try?
735,I decided to invest in an eKettle and [admittedly] impulsively bought the titled product. Amazon had a $20 coupon that brought it $50 so figured why not. I like the Gooseneck design as I have hand disabilities so anything to help make pouring easier the better (can also use for pourover coffee which is a plus)
736,"However I'm really underwhelmed by this device. For the Green Tea (175), it took 2mins 46 seconds. 195 took approximately 3 mins 37 seconds, and (from cold start) boiling took a whopping ~10 minutes. Maybe I'm misinformed from what I'm reading but eKettles on average should be able to boil water <3 minutes, let alone 10.  I drink primarily black and pu'erh teas, so that's my daily driver I rely on. The buttons also feel really cheap, and the 'Keep Warm' temperature shuts off after 2 minutes... I've tested multiple times and tried different power outlets. When I remove the kettle to pour and replace it, I have to re-select my temp and keep warm button and it has to reach temp again. I feel like this is not how a 'Keep Warm' button was designed to function."
737,"Not sure if I'm having high expectations and this is normal, but I feel like I can get a more admirable product. My budget is $80 (I was being cheap) but I can flex the extra $20 if it makes that much of a difference and retains the ideally Gooseneck design."
738,"If anyone else has this product, tell me how you're liking it and if this is simply a defect. The box came slightly beat up so that could be just as likely."

I found if I get five boxes I get a six one free on a website, that's about $40ish, but then I have to pay about $48 for shipping. Anyone know anywhere else I can get it shipped NZ to USA?

777,Hi all.
778,"Now, my question is about how many types, i.e. shapes of teapots/teawares are necessary to have and if they do really differ if the same amount of water to leaf ratio, as well as the extraction time, do kept the same? I'm into buying many different types of teas, hence my question."
779,"Like, does buying a gaiwan, a kyusu, a ball-shaped teapot, a shiboridashi, a hohin and a high cylinder-shaped teapot make sense, beyond the feelings of them and the aesthetics? Will it provide a different taste if the temperature of the water, ratio, infusion time and everything else stays the same? Or if some are more suited for some teas beyond the gaiwan and in general Chinese teaware not being great for Japanese leaves but still can be solved with a strainer or just buying a Japanese teapot for everything else anyway?"
780,Thanks for the answers in advance.
781,"I abruptly had to switch from coffee to mostly green teas for a health reason and the feeling I get from tea is absolutely different than from coffee. I feel more calm, less anxiety, but I also feel like the caffeine ‚Äúhits‚Äù differently from tea. I‚Äôm drinking abut 5-6 cups of green tea but not feeling much buzz at all although that should be equal to a cup of coffee. How do you all feel?"
782,"I recently tried to recreate an iced Thai tea that I had at a local restaurant from the tea leaves and spices that I already had. Almost everywhere I looked used a specific brand of Thai tea that already had the spices inside. For the recipes that did have a from-scratch recipe, none had a common consensus. From the various recipes I read I came up with this recipe:"
783,4 cups water 4 tbs black tea leaves (I used Assam) 1 cinnamon stick 2 star anise 2 green cardamom pods 3/4th cup of sugar Topped with sweetened condensed milk or some other dairy product
784,Optional: 2 Cloves (didn‚Äôt have them)
785,The tea came very close to what I had but my roommate who is Indian said what I had was exactly like the chai his parents would drink every day. Was this a coincidence or did I really just make chai? I know Assam is an Indian tea so maybe that makes a bigger difference than I thought but I wouldn‚Äôt know.

795,"I *think* I have narrowed down what the parameters of what I am looking for:- Taste like the Tazo Concentrate (but not $15 per L).- Be very cheap and from Canada.- I assume to be cheap I will need to brew it myself, that's fine, tips and tricks welcome!- Ability to have/make it in a concentrated form so I can water it down."

798,"I know taste is subjective, but I'm a snob about Earl Grey. I know what a good Earl Grey is supposed to taste like, and it's got to be good. The bergamot has got to exist and be strong, bold, rich, poignant, tasteful and flavorful. Not overpowering, but not underpowered either."
799,"I used to really like Tea Forte's Earl Grey, it had a very strong bergamot taste which I loved, but early last year they changed the formula up, likely due to all the pandemic/inflation etc. I've noticed a lot of business going cheaper like this. Anyways, the tea now tastes like stale garbage."
800,"I've tried Earl Grey's from Bigelow, Twinings, Pantenger, Rishi, DavidsTea, Harney & Sons, Stash, Smith Teamaker, and all of them seriously suck. Rishi is acceptable quality, but overall they are all very low quality Earl Grey.

847,"A large part of the tea is the quality of the water I feel. I've gotten two filters on it to make it quite pure, however I hear that fancier spots will actually add minerals back into the water for flavor. That's part of the reason I have two filters, because the first was a water softener and it made the water too pure, and with that went some of the flavor. So the second filter is to add some stuff back in."

859,"My daily tea I drink is sold in bulk in the city, stash brand spiced chai. I finally made it to the city yesterday and filled up one of those clear produce bags with 70 bags of tea."
860,"This morning I was in a meditative mood and I was thinking that I need to be with whatever is, to appreciate it and not try to change it so much."
861,"So I got up and made my tea as normal, two bags in a big cup with water from the dispenser. I like it spicy. After letting it steep for a few minutes I took the bags out and noticed a difference in the smell right away. There was no spicy smell."
862,"I looked in the trash and the wrappers were in there. English breakfast wrappers, almost the same red packaging as my spiced chai. I looked at my produce bag full of tea to see if I had 68 bags of English breakfast, but no, I think those were the only two."
863,I'm not particularly fond of English breakfast so I went to grab the sugar and realized I was pranking myself. Now I am drinking straight English breakfast and appreciating it as best as I can.

889,"I‚Äôm a huge fan of Thai Iced Tea; I pretty much get it every chance I get. Every time I get this tea, it has the brewed tea on the bottom half of the cup, and the milk on the top half."
890,"I know that, in regards to alcohol, layering like this is heavily dependent on alcohol versus sugar content. When poured on top of the other, a drink with a lot of sugar will not mix with a drink with a lot of alcohol, generally (I‚Äôm not a bartender, so that‚Äôs my very basic understanding haha)."
891,"But Thai Tea perplexes me; there isn‚Äôt any alcohol, so what chemical reactions are occurring so that they don‚Äôt mix?"
892,"I‚Äôve been experimenting around with different additives for my tea and have pretty much failed across the board to imitate this. The closest that I‚Äôve gotten was mixing together an herbal and an oat-based milk substitute in a cup with a lot of ice, which is supposed to help."
893,"This actually worked pretty well, but it‚Äôs just not quite as visually prominent as what I‚Äôm looking for."
894,"Assuming the answer is as simple as ‚Äúthe density is what separates them,‚Äù what can I do to adjust the densities of either the tea or the milk without clouding the flavors of either?"
895,"Also, if anyone can give me a really sciency answer as to how layering works, that would also help tons!"

897,"I looked at T. Kettle's teas and they have some really fun flavours! I'm just surprised there are no posts about them, like at all? Are their teas not very good?"
898,"Thinking about going to one of their stores on Friday to get some samples (they have a $70 minimum for shipping which is steep... pun intended), but it's across town so I'm wondering if it's worth the trip.

908,I Don't Understand Tea and Taste
909,Hi there.
910,"What's everyone's take on the title? I often infuse tea I consume the 'western way' - not from a gaiwan, multiple times. So, 2.5-3g of tea for a ~250ml cup, infused twice for example for the sencha I drink, at 70C."
911,"Now, if I'm making a thermos (mine's 750ml) full of the stuff, I could go for 375ml 2 times - using 4.5 grams of tea accordingly, or I could just dump those 4.5 grams of tea into the 750ml all at once and let it steep for both the times combined. How would that be different/'worse'?"
912,"Of course, this is not talking about expensive, high end tea that you're really meant to savor every last bit of; I'm fairly cost-oriented with tea I just drink on the side, and the sencha I took as an example costs 9$ for 150g. It's not as good as the more expensive stuff, but it's tasty, especially as a 'drink without thinking' drink."
913,I'll have to do some testing myself - and will report back with my personal results. I'm preliminarily interested in what people here think.
914,"Considering I often also brew some oolongs grandpa-style, where I use way less tea-matter than I would otherwise if I only want to have like 2 full cups worth and get 'more' out of it by just leaving the tea in while refilling hot water, that'd be a similar case, right?"
915,"I currently have this FORLIFE teapot, but the strainer has gotten stained (rusted?) over the months and I can't use it anymore. The inside of the teapot is also stained/hard to clean. I brew mostly black tea and the occasional green and herbal. What's a good teapot (under $100) that will last me? Is there something I should know about cleaning strainers? I've been putting them in a dishwasher since they all say dishwasher safe, but have the same staining issues with other strainers too."
916,"Hi. So last night I made a cup of tea. I like to add coffee creamer in it. Not sure how popular that is to do, but I know a lot use milk. At least in my country(Denmark)"
917,"So I had the thought, how come there are no tea bags for sale with coffee creamer inside already?"
918,"I ripped a tea bag open, put some creamer in it and resealed it tight. It worked great - was afraid that the powder would klump and expand so much , the bag would rip. This was not the case, and in my own opinion was that it worked great. Why is this not a thing? I‚Äôm thinking of making it a thing - seems like a good idea to me. What obstacles am I not seeing here?"
919,"I recently decided to regularly start drinking tea again. I remember that I used to drink a tea consisting of liquorice and fennel everyday, but when trying to find it, I noticed the company had changed the recipe adding orange. I unfortunately don‚Äôt like the new recipe very much and was hoping someone could recommend another preferably sweet tea, perhaps one that tastes similar?"
920,"Hello, I have picked samples of sheng teas from YS as I would like to discover a variety of that type of teas. Though, at some point I wondered something very important: EU and French customs."
921,"Did any of you order from YS to be delivered in France or more generally in the European Union? What do I have to do in order to import these alimentary goods and how much extra can I be charged for that (customs fees, taxes)? The web page from the government I found is not very clear to me, especially for the fact I am a citizen, not a company and I don't know if the same rules and taxes apply."
922,"Thanks in advance for your help, Hugo."
923,"I‚Äôve been drinking Harney‚Äôs Kagoshima Yutaka Midori which I‚Äôve taken a pretty strong liking to. Any recommendations for a Yutaka Midori source that may be superior? I always feel like I‚Äôm paying too much for branding and convenience with Harney. However, I wouldn‚Äôt mind spending more if I knew that I was getting a better product."
924,"With harvests coming up I want to have a solid wishlist in place, and trying discounted teas from last year seems like a good approach to making those decisions."
925,"I've never really been *into* tea, so to speak. I've occasionally made black tea with some sugar and sometimes butter for that creamy top."
926,"I got sick recently and my boyfriend got me a variety tea pack. A lot of them are herbals (not black tea) and smell pretty good, but I found out with my first cup that adding butter was a terrible idea. Which I'm fine with- it was a bit of a novelty, anyway. But one thing that's sort of bothering me is that I can't get flavor without dunking an ungodly amount of sugar in them. I feel like I'm doing something wrong."
927,I'm really big on flavor and drinking hot bitter water with no taste is not really something I enjoy. But I can't just give up on this herbal pack because my boyfriend got it for me and there's a lot I don't want to go to waste. Does anyone have some advice for me when it comes to making herbal tea taste good?

937,"I've been writing a lot about Thai teas lately, from the Wawee area, from a producer with that name, and this review post covers a second theme I've recently written about, how acclimation to sheng pu'er character works out."
938,"Thai teas have come a long way in the last decade.  Even just 5 years ago I could summarize that Chinese, Taiwanese, and Japanese teas were the best, and Vietnamese teas are better than Thai versions as a next level.  For what I've been reviewing recently that's not true, and some Thai versions aren't giving up much to any others.  Range isn't quite as diverse as all those other places, but there are very old plants from an older tradition (that went into making this one I'm reviewing), and new imports for plant types and produced styles, so it's not so limited either."
939,"Aging teas may not be a familiar theme (this one is 9 years old).  It only applies to a few types, mostly to sheng and shu pu'er, hei cha, and white teas, with other exceptions.  This review isn't really about the transition cycle but it covers a good bit of what changes.  In short for sheng pu'er it's a bit like green tea but not heated quite as much, leaving some compounds active and able to keep transitioning across time.  A somewhat bitter and astringent character, like green tea but different, transitions to warmer tones, different flavors, and softer and richer feel.  Most people probably wouldn't like this tea, because it's not in the most approachable range just now, and would have broader appeal in another 6 or 8 years.  I do, but I'm acclimated to aspect range others might find challenging, or bad."

956,"I‚Äôm living in Melbourne, Australia and we are said to have ‚Äúone of the best tap waters in the world‚Äù. But I disagree. I grew up in the Netherlands and we have far better, though hard, water without any added chemicals. Melbourne‚Äôs water comes from rainwater catchments, is very soft, and they add chlorine and fluoride in it (they have actual ‚Äúfluoridation PLANTS‚Äù ffs!üòµ‚Äçüí´). I find it doesn‚Äôt do most kinds of tea justice, so I also use Evian or other kinds of alkaline water to mix with the tap water for tea. That is problematic though due to cost, environmental impact and microplastics. I‚Äôve tried a Brita too and had a really bad experience: bitter water with particles of carbon filter. Therefore, I‚Äôm after a better solution and I hope you guys can give me some ideas‚Ä¶ TIA"

1004,Around this time I quit smoking.
1005,First week of December I forgot to take my meds until later in the day. I recently started working night shift. Took my meds about 14 hours late‚Ä¶ ate some food‚Ä¶ it didn‚Äôt taste right. So I didn‚Äôt finish the food. I went to work‚Ä¶ ended up puking three hours into shift. Was having migraine like auras... Went home early. Continued to puke. Couldn‚Äôt hold a cigarette down. Was having with drawls. But also migraines. It was this gross cycle. Didn‚Äôt feel that great waking up but was mostly back to ‚Äúnormal.‚Äù (As normal as someone with CFS can be.)
1006,"Late December I have a half sweet tea, half unsweet tea drink, I‚Äôm in the truck with my friend, and I take my meds‚Ä¶ I vomit."

1008,In between the month of January I am getting regularly nauseous but am feeling generally worn down. I have several migraines but I catch them in time before I have crazy bad responses.
1009,Feb 04‚Ä¶ I take my meds a bit later in the day than normal. I grab some what-a-burger on the way to work. Take my meds. I have a half sweet tea half unsweet tea with my meds. I‚Äôm feeling decent! Later I have two cookies offered to me by my client. I was doing fine. I finish my job. Suddenly‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm on my way home and I feel like throwing up. I have symptoms of a migraine. But I don‚Äôt want to stop. I want to get home. The second I am on the ground I vomit several times. I go to bed‚Ä¶ and feel decent when I wake up the next day. Not the greatest.
1010,Between Feb 05-11 I am doing my best to take my meds on time. But I‚Äôm still feeling nauseous every time I take the. With food or without.
1011,Feb 12 I take my meds with food. I‚Äôm doing great that day. I go to church. Suddenly‚Ä¶ I am feeling very ill. I have a migraine. I fight the urge to vomit because I took the Eucharist (I a catholic and I was worried it would be disrespectful. I asked my priest about it after mass and he said not to worry.) so I am okay if I puke now. I go home. Take Tylenol and take a 3 hour nap to rest. I wake up mostly okay. (Side note I start taking a lower dose of my meds)
1012,Feb 13 I take my meds on an empty stomach and I‚Äôm queezy af but I have a test for school and I don‚Äôt want to get a 0. So I go. I vomit right before the class.
1013,"Feb 14. I have my meds like normal without food. I have a decent day. My dad takes my mom and I to dinner for Valentine‚Äôs Day. I love the food. It was great. Suddenly.

She says I have sepsis and need to go to the ER. I don‚Äôt agree with her about having sepsis. I call my PCP and make an appointment.
1015,I cancel going to work because I‚Äôm not feeling well. I feel hit by a truck. I can‚Äôt eat but I have two bites of soup. I take my meds finally. I feel like crap. I sleep all night into the next day at 10 am.
1016,Feb 16. I wake up feeling nauseous at 10 am. I don‚Äôt eat. I cancel school. My doctors apt is at 2:30 pm. She says she thinks my problem is my CFS and that I keep getting viral infections? This doesn‚Äôt feel right to me. I take my meds around 5 pm. I am very nauseous and eat some tortillas. So far I am okay but very tired. My throat is so sore from throwing up on Tuesday night and it‚Äôs not getting better. I fact it‚Äôs getting worse.
1017,Please help me. I don‚Äôt know what to do.

1032,3 Cups of Green Tea
1033,Review[1/21] - 2022 Mi Lan Xiang - High Mountain Honey Orchid
1034,Who is the Ippodo of black tea?
1035,Is it okay if I drink 3 cups (24oz) of green tea (Dave‚Äôs imperial) in one sitting instead of throughout the day?
1036,Overall impression: 7/10 tea. Price per session 4.80$. Strong start but has a weak finish compared to a tea of similar quality. Solid value for price point but not a must get.
1037,2022 mi lan Xiang - high mountain honey orchid - the honey is apparent from the first steep. Smooth and aromatic it holds all the characteristics you would expect of a dancong(cooling yolky flavor). There is a grain that separates very quickly so a tall cup is what I would recommend and let the grain collect at the bottom through the session to avoid if you aren‚Äôt a fan of astringencies. Otherwise give the cup a little swirl before drinking to get consistent flavor.
1038,"In infusions 5-9 the aromatics fade away and you are left with a more intense leaf flavor, which in this case was yolky with more floral notes to it. This flavor sits on your tongue for a several minutes."
1039,The last 3 infusions were kind of a disappointment. It became clear the leaves had given all the flavor they could at infusion 12 and the 3 before it became increasingly difficult to nail down the flavor notes which were much more apparent in earlier infusions.
1040,Brewing methodology: I have a lot of experience brewing dancong so it‚Äôs hard to put it into works why I choose the timings I do. It starts off with 8-10 second infusions and drops to 3-5 as the flavor picks up. This is followed by rapidly increasing brew times until I feel the tea is done.
1041,Tea was brewed in silver pot and gold cup with boiling water.
1042,Link to tea here.
1043,I mostly drink gyokuro/sencha from Ippodo but would like to find a black tea retailer of a similar quality.

1068,I've been looking for German tea shops for quite a while now and if I'm being honest I didn't really like any of them. I now found Sunday natural and the shop and the tea seems to be quite good but since they don't only sell Chinese tea and also sell supplements I'm kinda sceptical. If y'all had good experiences drop some recommendations into the comments too.
1069,Looking through the vendors and there are SO MANY options to buy from. So someone please recommend me a black tea so I can slim it down a bit.

1075,"I live in Cyprus and my sister brought me a bag of milk oolong 880 from Whittard and I can't find anything close to it (or even oolong) locally. The closest I've been is cantata (a shop in Limassol, Cyprus) which has pure oolong that is too expensive for me and a ""milky oolong"" which is a blend of oolong and instant milk."
1076,"Hi everybody! I'm getting into gongfu tea brewing, and I have what might be a dumb question, but... every resource I see on ""how long should I steep my tea leaves"" tends to go either with very short increments of time (10-20 seconds, etc) or what seem like very long (like 5 minutes). I don't mean between green and black teas, but even just the recommended times for an oolong. I've been using a 150mL gaiwan with 5 grams of tieguanyin oolong, and 5 minutes seems unimaginably long to me. Am I getting something wrong, or do some people just prefer really over-extracted tea? Is there that much difference between gongfu tea sets?"
1077,I ran into a friend yesterday mid tea ceremony and he offered my a cup. Tasted like berries. I'd be really surprised if this tea wasn't artificially flavored but the label and their website doesn't suggest this.
1078,Does anybody have the answer?
1079,"I am currently using a flexible mesh-type brewing basket with a rather coarse mesh, but I was wondering whether any improvement could be made. Broadly speaking I have found three different types of basket:"
1080,"Types like what I have now: a full-metal coarser mesh basketThe mesh is not very sturdy, and when throwing away tea, it often sticks to the mesh."
1081,"Types like Finum: a very fine mesh type basket with a plastic frame.I wonder whether the plastic frame would interact with the tea's taste, and whether the tea would stick to the mesh."
1082,Types like Forlife: full-metal baskets with somewhat larger holes.
1083,"Would any of these two other types be an upgrade, and if so, which one would be best?"
1084,"The worst tea I‚Äôve ever had was cranberry orange tea. It had a rancid, tangy taste. It tasted like orange squeezed into red cooking wine. Also the tea leaves itself looked like a bunch of earthly drugs. No amount of sugar could save it."

1098,Does anyone know anything about this tea? I was looking it up and couldn't really find anything about it..?
1099,Hey guys! I‚Äôm just wondering if anyone can recommend some really tasty/unique tea. I‚Äôm trying to stop drinking coffee and I‚Äôd like to have something that‚Äôs tasty enough that perhaps I‚Äôd prefer it over my morning coffee!
1100,my first sprouts!
1101,"Asking this question--I am mostly thinking of dissolved oxygen. Would using stovetop kettles, to boil your water, maybe decrease the amount of dissolved oxygen compared to an electric kettle? since the water is being exposed to higher temperatures, maybe? I'm unsure, I've only ever used a stovetop kettle so if anyone who has used both could provide some insight, as to whether or not it would be worth making a switch, I'd be appreciative."
1102,"So I don‚Äôt do this often, but when I have black tea in an open cup, it can taste good enough after 12 hours. That‚Äôs a cup that has no lid."
1103,"However, I have a glass bottle with a screw on top, and a straw (on the top) that you flip (but it doesn‚Äôt extend into the cup; you have to tilt it upside down to get any tea out). In like 9 hours, it tastes bad."
1104,"I also do not put them in the fridge, I have them by my bed instead."
1105,My assumption is that it‚Äôs going bad because it doesn‚Äôt have ‚Äúfresh‚Äù air since there‚Äôs a top. I‚Äôve cleaned the bottle a lot (although not between every drink in it). So I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs that.
1106,"I think I‚Äôm gonna stop altogether with letting tea set overnight out of the fridge. Maybe that will help. But I have also had the same thing happen while the tea is in the fridge. Maybe I need to do a better clean with the bottle? I‚Äôm not entirely sure what to do, or why it tastes off only when there‚Äôs a top on (or maybe it‚Äôs just this bottle? I‚Äôll test out others)."
1107,"If no one has a solution, that‚Äôs fine. I‚Äôm mainly just wondering what is actually happening, and if my glass bottle has some bacteria in it that‚Äôs hard to get to."
1108,"I am now trying teas and herbals other than black tea. What is the best option for a tempature controlled kettle, and is it better to brew in a cup or in the kettle?"

I've had two matcha today, which is more than caffeine than my single shot. Now I have a withdrawal headache--first day with one. This is day seven of the taper down. Does this make sense?"
1117,"I think coffee affects me differently than tea, and I find it harder to quit. Luckily, I also feel a ton better when I do quit. But, I'm worried I'll have three days or more of headaches. Sigh. I also am avoiding decaf, though I used it during the previous 6 days."

1184,I really want to buy one but most of them run $50+ which seems very steep for what they are.. I‚Äôve seen clear glass ones for around $20 but I assume they‚Äôd probably be looked down upon in the tea community. Can someone give me some insight as to why they cost so much?
1185,"They have really fun Fandom blends so I ordered a bunch of samplers to try from them... and honestly have been quite disappointed. The price isn't that cheap, and I feel like the teas I've gotten haven't been great. But I don't know if it's because I've not gotten the right things?"
1186,"Some flavored teas have really artificial scents I can't get over, especially with fruits like cherry or peach"
1187,"The tea leaves themselves are all broken up or very twiggy (and not the type where it's a sign of a really good tea, like say in a fuzzy white, but like they're bulking up weight)"
1188,"Teas tend to go bitter / astringent very easily - maybe it's just user error but I swear I've made a lot of teas and ususally don't have this difficult a time. They also feel a little flat, like not a lot of notes and lacking rich or smooth mouthfeel"
1189,"Even the loose leaf doesn't typically hold up to second steep, and definitely not a third steeps, which makes each cup quite expensive, I feel?"
1190,Have people had similar experiences? Should I be ordering other things from them?
1191,"I see they've a premium range, but I've been a hard enough time with their other stuff that I'm having a hard time justifying pulling the trigger on that."
1192,"For context, I typically drink unflavored teas‚Äîwith a preference for Chinese & Taiwanese teas. I like good oolongs, followed by some combination of whites & greens. I thought Adagio would be a good way to move more into tisanes, especially because I like drinking at night while I'm working right before bed. So I got the roobois/honeybush samplers, some fruit teas, and a few pure greens/oolongs just to try it out. Maybe my expectations are just all wrong. I'm sad because their packaging is so cute ;_;"
1193,I'm a big fan of the wanpo tea shop and their lemon black tea. Their website says they use Island black tea. I've tried researching this but not having much luck. I found a translation below that it seems to be this type of tea where milky oolong comes up but I dont think it's the same. It also led me to this tea shop. Has anyone shopped here before?

It's kept me satisfied so far and I have a dedicated clay pot for making it but I really want to spread my wings a bit and dive in deeper. I'm my experience there's usually a price point for tea that will get you 85-95% as good as it gets and then you have to really come out of pocket for that last 15-5% due to law of diminishing returns. Hoping for some recommendations for something in that 85-95% range and a good source. Willing to spend but not trying to get into that last range where lots of money gets marginal improvements. I know of the teastore list in the FAQ but it's pretty long so I was hoping to hone in on a few stores to start spending with. Thank you for any input."

1210,I set the steep out about 8 PM and woke up to try them around 9-10 AM. I thought cold brewing would eliminate or lessen the normal bitterness; maybe I should have just let them steep for way less time.

Maybe I do not understand what milk oolong is supposed to be like, and I am expecting too much‚Äînothing in terms of sweetness on either as well."

There is no where to buy it locally anymore that I know of. I‚Äôm not knowledgeable about what‚Äôs good but I know I like green teas, I‚Äôm currently drinking an organic green tea from a company called Jona (I think, the bag also says JAS). I read the faq and learned a great deal. I have a cup at work with an infuser. I‚Äôm wondering if anyone knows of or has any suggestions for somewhere I can order sample packs or has a suggestion for green teas. I live in the United States if that makes a difference.

I bought some to see if it works just as well and it doesn‚Äôt. Sure I felt less stressed but it did nothing to alleviate my depression. I even tried it with caffeine to see if it would make a difference.  There‚Äôs got to be more to tea than l theanine. Is it magic? Lol"

1322,"So as you can imagine, I was quite taken aback and confused at this experience. DHP is supposed to be the ""king of teas,"" and this particular DHP gets raving reviews on Steepster."
1323,I am wondering if anyone has had a similar experience with DHP or roasted oolongs in general. Could this just be a bad batch that suffered from excessive roasting? It makes me anxious to try other Wuyi oolongs even though everyone drools over them.

1337,"I've been buying at Yunnan Sourcing for years and spent a lot of money there (> USD 3000,- since 2016). My last order was rather small (USD 186,-). Usually orders were arriving in about 2 months but it says it can take up to 20 weeks. My last order however, did never arrive. The link to the package tracking was never updating so I thought maybe this is one of those that only update once when the package arrives. I was actually wondering why Yunnan Sourcing showed my order as Fulfilled but didn't bother. Yesterday I wrote them and told them that my order didn't arrive. I hadn't asked before and was never informed about issues. They said that the order was sent back to them due to a customs issue. I asked if they can send it again and they said it would cost USD 19,- shipment fees again."
1338,As I'm not sure if there is a general issue with customs to my country now I said that I would prefer having a refund. Here comes what really surprised me in a negative way:
1339,"They said that if I want a refund, they will not only deduct the USD 19,- for shipment services they have spent, but also additional 30 % (USD 49.50) restocking fee. They wrote this:"
1340,"""Your refund would break down as follows:"
1341,Order Total: $185.68
1342,Minus the Following:
1343,Original Shipping: $19.03
1344,Return Shipping: $19.03 30%
1345,Restocking Fee: $49.50 ($ Item total x.30)
1346,"Refund Total: $98.12"""
1347,I still can't believe it as they have gotten back the shipment and I would not need to pay restocking fee if I pay the shipment fee again so they can send the package again.
1348,I'm pretty disappointed by that customer service level as I consider myself as an easy customer and never heard about something like that in regard to Yunnan Sourcing.
1349,Am I overreacting and is this customer service level normal?
1350,PS: I never had quality issues with Yunnan Sourcing. My complaint concerns the customer service.
1351,Edit: It turns out that the invoice Yunnan Sourcing includes in the package includes lower prices and a lower total amount than what was actually paid. Some users suggest that this might be customs fraud.

1376,"I have enjoyed green teas over the years but only casually. I've found a few that I love for daily drinking and would love to explore more. One is actually a bag, probably the best of the supermarket green teas in a bag: Stash Premium Green. My suspicion is it's a Sencha (the website says its ""processed in the traditional Japanese style""), as a generic bag of Japanese Sencha I found at an Asian food market is very similar. I love the fact it is almost savory in character and not very astringent. I'm wondering, what other green teas would be good to try? My thought turned to just exploring more upscale Sencha teas but wondered what you thought."
1377,"I'm super sensitive to caffeine, so I always get green tea based boba. Normally, I don't get a buzz from green tea. However, when I have boba tea, I get a noticeable buzz. Does this happen to anyone else? Any ideas why? I'm not drinking any more tea than I normally would. I also get the drinks half or quarter sweetened, so I'm not sure that would give me a noticeable buzz."
1378,"When I was a kid in the southern US, we used to make sun tea, which is where you take a big ass mason jar and fill it with tea bags, sugar and water and stick that sucker in the sun for a few hours. There was always something that seemed special about sun tea, but I don't really know as an adult if it's any good, and haven't tried in a while. Maybe I'll try again next summer.

It gets really hot this time of year and we're outside in the sun for a few hours, so I figured I'd make a large bottle or two of iced peppermint tea, but I'm unsure of how to go about making this. I did look up a few things including measurements, tips, and instructions, but most websites seemed to contradict each other or give different information that wasn't mentioned in the other."
1476,"I would really appreciate some advice or tips on how to go about this, there will be around 30 people attending and I'm going to assume they all love peppermint tea so I don't under cater; I'll drink it if they don't anyway. How would I go about this?"
1477,"Monday, February 06 - Sunday, February 12"
1478,"Hi! I travel to the San Jose/ South Bay Area about twice a month for work. Are there any amazing tea spots I need to check out? When I‚Äôm all the way in SF I love Vital Tea Leaf, but I‚Äôm nearly never up that far north."
1479,Every time I try to google a place it‚Äôs just another boba shop.
1480,"I'd like to get into tea more but I'm not sure what sort of flavors I will like. My favorites are green and herbal but I'm open to anything. I love genmaicha (roasted rice green tea), Korean barley tea, jasmine green tea, and peppermint. What sort of descriptions should I look for when trying new teas? Or what would be similar flavors to these? I don't know how to describe them, I just know I like them! Thanks for anyone's help!"
1481,I recently brought loose leaf tea and relised after buying it that I would need to purchase to store it in.
1482,"I googled it and it told me that an opaque, airtight jar is best. Is there any way to tell if a jar is appropriate for storing tea and is airtight? Is there anything else I should be aware of when storing tea?"
1483,"I have a bag of quite unpalatable matcha sitting around that I would like to use up because it feels like a waste to throw it out. I don‚Äôt bake, and I try not to drink lattes often because I‚Äôm lactose intolerant."
1484,"I don't mean like green tea or black tea with floral flavoring, I mean actual dried flowers meant for making tea. I'm looking for a lot of specific ones: chrysanthemum, cherry blossom, violet, clover, lotus, lily, calendula, carnation, peach blossom and rose."
1485,"I've seen some on Etsy, but man the shipping can be pricey for some items. I also saw some sellers on eBay offering many of these particular teas, but I'm not sure how reputable they are. The sellers called thenbuyone and green_heart_store seem to have lots of good reviews on their teas and they have almost all the teas I'm looking for between them. I'm leaning toward these the most because of the variety as well as the prices."
1486,"I checked out the vendor list and I'm familiar with a few of them already, but most of them appear to offer typical green/white/black/etc. teas or blends whereas I'm just looking to make tea out of flowers and nothing else. I know what I'm looking for might not necessarily be available on tea sites just because I know tea made from anything other than tea leaves might not be considered ""true"" tea, depending on the vendor."
1487,"Are there any places you might recommend for dried, drinkable flowers? I did see a couple vendors from the list that had a handful of the flowers I'm looking for, namely calendula, rose and chrysanthemum flowers."
1488,"Hey folks,"
1489,"My kitchen's electric tea kettle finally burnt out after several years of faithful service, so I'm looking for something new."
1490,"Now that I have a job with disposable income, I'd like to get something that actually fits my needs."
1491,"I have a Stagg EKG pourover kettle (and I've brought it with me when I travel), but its size makes it a bit irritating to constantly refill from the fridge and the gooseneck doesn't really fit on my counter."
1492,Some features that are important to me:
1493,Standard 120V/15A AC wiring used in North America
1494,"Large capacity, preferably 1.75~2L (the Stagg's 1L doesn't go far when making multiple carafes of iced tea)"
1495,"Reasonably adjustable temperature (my last kettle had 4 different setpoints, but no matching one for oolong tea - the Stagg is fully adjustable but that's a bit overkill IMO)"
1496,"Temperature hold (my last kettle only boiled for 3 minutes, but the Stagg will hold for longer and I've gotten kinda spoiled by it)"
1497,"Easy to clean (no exposed heating elements, smooth sides, etc.)"
1498,Can anyone personally recommend a kettle with features along the lines of what's described above?
1499,"I usually drink Pu‚ÄôErh and loose leaf CTC Assam at home, but it‚Äôs a hassle at work so I just go with teabags. I drink my tea black with no sugar, and like it strong and malty, with lots of body and mouth feel. I don‚Äôt mind tannins either."
1500,I‚Äôm looking for an accessible mass-market tea. Which tea do you recommend as the strongest?
1501,"For the record, the ones I‚Äôve tried are Builders, Thompson‚Äôs Titanic and Punjana, PG Tips, Yorkshire Red and Gold, Twinnings Irish Breakfast, Glen-something, Brewleys Irish, King Cole, Tetleys Bold and English Breakfast, and Ahmad Earl Gray and Special Blend.  I want something stronger without having to double bag"
1502,The ones I still want to try are Barry‚Äôs Black and Lyons Gold.
1503,Am I missing any?
1504,"Edit: I‚Äôve read lots of threads on what people think is the Best bagged trees, but I‚Äôm looking for Strongest"
